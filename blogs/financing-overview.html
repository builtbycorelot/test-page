  <p><strong>Buying‚Äîor building‚Äîyour next home shouldn‚Äôt feel like decoding a bank manual.</strong> Below is a plain-English guide to today‚Äôs six most popular loan products, plus insider tips from our lending partners <strong>Scott Hine</strong> and <strong>Philip King</strong>.</p>
</section>

<h2>USDA Guaranteed Loan</h2>
<p>A zero-down mortgage backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for eligible rural areas (yes, many suburban ZIPs qualify). Income caps apply, but rates are typically lower than conventional loans and the guarantee fee can be rolled into the loan.</p>

<h2>VA Loan</h2>
<p>Available to active-duty service members, veterans, and some spouses. <strong>0% down, no PMI</strong>, and capped closing costs make this the gold standard if you qualify. We help secure your Certificate of Eligibility and navigate VA appraisal requirements.</p>

<h2>FHA Loan</h2>
<p>Designed for first-time buyers or anyone needing a more flexible credit profile. Minimum 3.5 % down with scores ‚â•580. Upfront and monthly MIP applies but can be refinanced out later. FHA‚Äôs 203(b) program pairs well with CORELOT‚Äôs <a href="../blogs/corelot-design-process.html">Design-Build pathway</a>.</p>

<h2>Conventional Loan</h2>
<p>Great credit? Stable income? A conventional loan often yields the best long-term savings. Put as little as 3 % down with HomeReady/HomePossible or remove PMI sooner with 20 % down. Ask about rate-lock programs if your build is &gt;120 days.</p>

<h2>Construction-to-Permanent (C-to-P)</h2>
<p>A single closing covers both construction and the final mortgage, protecting you from double sets of fees. Interest-only payments during the build keep cash flow predictable. We coordinate draw schedules directly with Scott &amp; Philip to keep crews paid and your timeline on track.</p>

<h2>USDA Direct Loan</h2>
<p>For low- to very-low-income households in rural areas. The USDA services these loans directly, offering payment assistance that can push effective rates below 1 %. Longer approval windows mean you‚Äôll want to start the application early in your home-planning journey.</p>
