        <h1>Custom Home Financing Overview</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">Understanding your financing options for building a custom home</p>
      </div>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Financing Is Different for Custom Homes</h2>
        <p>If you've bought a home before, you're familiar with getting a mortgage. You apply, get approved, close on the house, and start making payments. Straightforward.</p>

        <p>Financing a custom home is more complex because you're not buying something that exists—you're funding its construction. That requires different loan structures, different approval processes, and different documentation.</p>

        <p>The good news? Once you understand your options, custom home financing isn't as intimidating as it might seem. We've helped hundreds of clients navigate this process, and we'll walk you through everything you need to know.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>The Main Financing Options</h2>
        <p>Most custom homebuilders use one of these financing approaches:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>1. Construction-to-Permanent Loan (One-Close)</h3>
          <p>This is our most recommended option for most clients. You apply once, close once, and the loan covers both construction and your permanent mortgage.</p>
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> One closing saves money and hassle, locks your rate before construction, seamless transition from construction to mortgage</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not all lenders offer them, may have slightly higher rates than standalone mortgages</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Most custom home projects where you're financing both construction and long-term ownership</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>2. Construction Loan + Separate Mortgage (Two-Close)</h3>
          <p>You get a short-term construction loan to fund the build, then refinance to a permanent mortgage after completion.</p>
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> More lenders offer this structure, potentially lower mortgage rates</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Two sets of closing costs, two applications, rate risk between loans, more paperwork</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Situations where construction-to-permanent loans aren't available or you prefer to shop for a mortgage after completion</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>3. Cash Construction + Mortgage Later</h3>
          <p>Pay for construction with cash, then take out a traditional mortgage after the home is complete.</p>
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Best mortgage rates, single closing, no construction loan interest</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires significant liquid capital, ties up money during construction</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Buyers with substantial cash reserves who don't want construction loan complexity</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>4. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)</h3>
          <p>Borrow against equity in your current home to fund construction, then pay it off with a mortgage or sale proceeds.</p>
          <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Can leverage existing equity, flexible draw schedule</p>
          <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Puts current home at risk, usually requires paying off before closing on new home</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Buyers with significant home equity who plan to sell their current home</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Specialized Loan Programs</h2>
        <p>Beyond conventional financing, several government-backed programs support custom homebuilding:</p>

        <h3>VA Construction Loans</h3>
        <p>Veterans and active-duty service members can finance custom homes through the VA loan program.</p>

        <p><strong>Key benefits:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>No down payment required in most cases</li>
          <li>No private mortgage insurance (PMI)</li>
          <li>Competitive interest rates</li>
          <li>Available as construction-to-permanent loans</li>
          <li>Funding fee can be financed into the loan</li>
        </ul>

        <p>VA loans have specific requirements around builder qualifications and construction standards, but we're experienced working within these guidelines.</p>

        <h3>USDA Construction Loans</h3>
        <p>USDA loans are available for properties in eligible rural and suburban areas (which includes much of our building region).</p>

        <p><strong>Key benefits:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>100% financing (no down payment)</li>
          <li>Below-market interest rates</li>
          <li>Lower mortgage insurance costs than FHA</li>
          <li>Income limits apply but are generous for most families</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Check the USDA eligibility map for your lot location—you might be surprised how many areas qualify.</p>

        <h3>FHA Construction Loans</h3>
        <p>FHA offers the 203(k) construction loan program allowing lower down payments (as low as 3.5%).</p>

        <p><strong>Key benefits:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lower down payment requirements</li>
          <li>More flexible credit requirements</li>
          <li>Can include lot purchase in the loan</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mortgage insurance required</li>
          <li>Loan limits apply (though they're generous in our market)</li>
          <li>More documentation and inspection requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Lenders Look For</h2>
        <p>Whether you're applying for conventional, VA, USDA, or FHA financing, lenders evaluate similar factors:</p>

        <h3>Credit Score</h3>
        <p>Construction loans typically require credit scores of 680+ for conventional financing. VA, USDA, and FHA programs may accept lower scores (sometimes as low as 580-620), though better scores get better rates.</p>

        <p>If your score needs work, address it before applying. Even small improvements can save thousands over the loan term.</p>

        <h3>Down Payment</h3>
        <p>Conventional construction loans typically require 10-20% down. Government programs offer lower down payment options or even zero-down (VA, USDA).</p>

        <p>Remember: your down payment applies to the total project cost (land + construction), not just the house construction cost.</p>

        <h3>Debt-to-Income Ratio</h3>
        <p>Lenders want your total monthly debt payments (including your new mortgage) to be no more than 43-45% of your gross monthly income. Some programs allow higher ratios with strong compensating factors.</p>

        <p>Include everything in this calculation: car loans, student loans, credit cards, child support—any recurring monthly obligation.</p>

        <h3>Income Stability</h3>
        <p>Lenders prefer to see two years of steady employment in the same field. Self-employed borrowers need two years of tax returns showing consistent income.</p>

        <p>Job changes during construction can complicate mortgage approval if you're using two-close financing. Construction-to-permanent loans protect against this.</p>

        <h3>Construction Plans and Budget</h3>
        <p>Lenders need detailed plans and a realistic budget. They want to ensure the loan amount is sufficient to complete the project and that the finished home's value will support the loan.</p>

        <p>We provide professional plans, specifications, and detailed cost breakdowns that lenders require. This is part of our service.</p>

        <h3>Builder Qualifications</h3>
        <p>Most lenders require you to work with a licensed, insured builder with a track record of completed projects. They want to know the home will actually get built.</p>

        <p>As an established builder, we're pre-approved with many lenders, which simplifies the process for our clients.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>The Application and Approval Process</h2>
        <p>Here's what to expect when applying for custom home financing:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Get pre-qualified.</strong> Initial conversation with a lender about income, debts, and credit to understand rough borrowing capacity</li>
          <li><strong>Get pre-approved.</strong> Formal application with documentation (pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements) resulting in a conditional approval letter</li>
          <li><strong>Finalize home plans and budget.</strong> Work with us to create construction-ready plans and detailed cost estimates</li>
          <li><strong>Submit plans to lender.</strong> Lender reviews plans, orders appraisal, and finalizes approval</li>
          <li><strong>Appraisal.</strong> Appraiser evaluates plans and lot to determine projected value when complete</li>
          <li><strong>Underwriting.</strong> Final review of all documentation and approval of loan</li>
          <li><strong>Closing.</strong> Sign documents, pay closing costs and down payment, receive loan funds</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This process typically takes 30-60 days from application to closing, though it can be faster or slower depending on complexity and lender workload.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Understanding Costs Beyond the Loan Amount</h2>
        <p>When budgeting, account for these expenses:</p>

        <h3>Closing Costs</h3>
        <p>Typically 2-5% of the loan amount. Includes appraisal fees, title insurance, attorney fees, origination fees, and various lender charges.</p>

        <p>With construction-to-permanent loans, you pay closing costs once. With two-close financing, you pay them twice (though the second closing is usually less expensive).</p>

        <h3>Construction Interest</h3>
        <p>During construction, you typically pay interest-only on funds disbursed. This amount varies based on your construction timeline and how quickly funds are drawn.</p>

        <p>On a $400,000 loan at 7%, if an average of $200,000 is outstanding during a 6-month construction period, you'd pay roughly $7,000 in construction interest.</p>

        <h3>Contingency Reserve</h3>
        <p>Most lenders require a 10% contingency reserve built into the loan to cover unexpected costs or changes. This is smart budgeting anyway.</p>

        <h3>Interim Housing</h3>
        <p>You'll likely need to pay rent or your existing mortgage during construction. Budget for 6-12 months of dual housing costs.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>When to Start the Financing Process</h2>
        <p>Start early. Ideally, talk to a lender before you even buy land or finalize plans. Here's why:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You'll understand what you can actually afford (avoiding disappointment later)</li>
          <li>You'll know whether land purchase can be included in your construction loan</li>
          <li>You can factor closing costs and reserves into your total budget</li>
          <li>If credit or income issues exist, you'll have time to address them</li>
          <li>You'll make design decisions knowing your budget constraints</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We're happy to discuss projects with clients who are still working on financing. It's better to have these conversations early than to design a home you can't afford to build.</p>
