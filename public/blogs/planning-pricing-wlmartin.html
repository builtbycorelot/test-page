        <h2>Why Planning Comes First</h2>
        <p>The best homes aren't accidents. They're the result of careful planning—thinking through how you'll actually live in the space, what matters most to you, and how to maximize value within your budget.</p>

        <p>Too often, people jump straight to picking out finishes or browsing floor plans without first establishing a clear framework. What's your real budget? What features are essential versus nice-to-have? How will this home need to function five or ten years from now? These questions matter more than whether you prefer gray or white cabinets.</p>

        <p>At CORELOT, we start every project with planning. Not because we love paperwork, but because thoughtful upfront work prevents expensive surprises later and ensures you end up with a home that truly fits your life.</p>

        <h2>The WL Martin Philosophy</h2>
        <p>WL Martin plans represent our commitment to purposeful design and predictable pricing. These aren't just floor plans—they're complete home packages that have been refined based on years of building experience and customer feedback.</p>

        <p>Every WL Martin plan is designed with intentionality. Rooms are sized appropriately for their function. Traffic flow makes sense. Storage is thoughtfully placed. The layout works for everyday living, not just magazine photos.</p>

        <p>But what really sets these plans apart is the pricing structure. Each WL Martin plan comes with transparent, itemized pricing that shows exactly what you're getting and what it costs. No vague allowances. No mysterious line items. Just clear numbers that let you make informed decisions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>How Our Pricing Works</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Base Price Transparency</h3>
          <p>Every WL Martin plan starts with a clearly defined base price. This includes all structural elements, standard finishes, and core features. You know from day one what the foundation of your home will cost—no guessing, no hidden fees, no "we'll figure it out later."</p>
          <p>The base price covers quality construction using proven materials and methods. These aren't bare-bones specs—they're what we'd actually want in our own homes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Upgrade Options Priced Upfront</h3>
          <p>Want to upgrade the countertops? Add a covered porch? Include a finished basement? Every common upgrade option is priced in advance.</p>
          <p>This pre-pricing serves two purposes: it speeds up decision-making and eliminates the anxiety of wondering whether something is "in budget." You can evaluate options confidently, knowing the exact cost impact.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Allowances That Make Sense</h3>
          <p>Some items—like appliances or light fixtures—offer so much variety that pre-selecting would limit your choices unnecessarily. For these, we use realistic allowances based on what items actually cost, not inflated numbers that hide builder profit.</p>
          <p>If you spend less than the allowance, you get a credit. If you choose to spend more, you know the difference upfront. Simple, fair, transparent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Site-Specific Costs Separated</h3>
          <p>Your lot characteristics—soil conditions, topography, utility distances—affect construction costs. We separate these site-specific costs from the base home price so you understand what's driven by the plan versus the property.</p>
          <p>This approach lets you make better decisions about lot selection. A cheaper lot with challenging soil might end up costing more overall than a slightly pricier lot with better conditions.</p>

        <h2>Planning for Your Actual Life</h2>
        <p>Great planning means designing for how you'll really use the home, not just how it looks on paper. We ask questions that matter:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Daily routines:</strong> Where do you drop your keys when you come home? Where will backpacks and shoes go? Do you need a mud room or will a well-designed entry closet suffice?</li>
          <li><strong>Work patterns:</strong> Will anyone work from home regularly? Do you need a dedicated office or can we create a flexible space that serves multiple purposes?</li>
          <li><strong>Family dynamics:</strong> Do you need separate kid and adult spaces? Will aging parents ever live with you? Are you planning to grow your family?</li>
          <li><strong>Entertaining style:</strong> Do you host formal dinners or casual gatherings? Does your kitchen need to accommodate multiple cooks?</li>
          <li><strong>Future flexibility:</strong> What might change in five or ten years? Can bedrooms convert to other uses? Is there room to expand if needed?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These conversations shape everything from room sizes to outlet placement. A home planned around your actual life will always feel better than one designed for some generic "average family."</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>The Value of Pre-Priced Packages</h2>
        <p>One of the biggest sources of stress in custom homebuilding is decision fatigue. When every choice requires research, pricing calls, and budget recalculations, the process becomes exhausting rather than exciting.</p>

        <p>WL Martin plans solve this by packaging common combinations. Want a craftsman exterior with an open floor plan and a finished basement? There's a pre-priced package for that. Prefer a farmhouse style with a covered porch and bonus room? That's already specced and priced too.</p>

        <p>This doesn't limit your options—you can still customize extensively. But it gives you solid starting points that make the process manageable. Instead of making 10,000 individual decisions, you make a few dozen meaningful choices about things that truly matter to you.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>How a Plan Grows With You</h2>
        <p>Smart planning considers not just today's needs but tomorrow's possibilities. The best homes adapt as your life changes.</p>

        <p>Maybe you start with three bedrooms but design in a way that converting the bonus room to a fourth bedroom is straightforward. Perhaps you finish the basement later when budget allows, but we run the electrical and plumbing rough-in during initial construction. Or you install a main-floor bedroom that serves as an office now but could be a guest room or parent's suite down the road.</p>

        <p>These "future-proofing" decisions don't necessarily cost more upfront, but they create flexibility that pays dividends over time. A well-planned home should be able to evolve with you rather than becoming obsolete when circumstances change.</p>

        <h2>Our Planning Process in Practice</h2>
        <p>Here's what planning looks like when you work with CORELOT:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Discovery conversation:</strong> We discuss your vision, lifestyle, priorities, and budget range. No sales pressure—just listening and learning.</li>
          <li><strong>Budget alignment:</strong> We establish realistic numbers based on your financing capacity and what you want to achieve. If there's a gap, we identify it early and explore solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Plan selection or customization:</strong> We review WL Martin plans that fit your criteria, or we discuss custom modifications. You see base pricing and upgrade options immediately.</li>
          <li><strong>Feature prioritization:</strong> We walk through decisions together, helping you understand trade-offs and make choices aligned with your priorities.</li>
          <li><strong>Detailed proposal:</strong> You receive a comprehensive proposal that itemizes every cost. No surprises, no ambiguity—just clear information to support your decision.</li>
          <li><strong>Refinement:</strong> We adjust based on your feedback until everything aligns with your vision and budget.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This methodical approach takes a little more time upfront, but it saves enormous headaches later. It ensures we're building the right home, not just any home.</p>

        <h2>The Value Proposition</h2>
        <p>Transparent planning and pricing deliver value in ways that extend beyond the bottom line:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> You know what you're getting and what it costs. No anxiety about hidden fees or budget overruns.</li>
          <li><strong>Control:</strong> Clear pricing lets you make informed trade-offs. Spend more on what matters most, save on what doesn't.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Pre-priced options and packages speed decisions and keep the project moving forward.</li>
          <li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> A home planned around your actual needs will feel right in ways that might be hard to articulate but are immediately obvious when you live there.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term thinking:</strong> Thoughtful planning creates homes that adapt as your life evolves, protecting your investment over time.</li>
        </ul>
