      </div>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>The Problem With "Affordable"</h2>
        <p>We hear it all the time: "I'm looking for an affordable custom home." But what does that actually mean?</p>

        <p>In homebuilding marketing, "affordable" has become practically meaningless. It's a word that gets slapped on everything from bare-bones starter homes to luxury builds with misleading base prices. Some builders advertise an "affordable" $300,000 home that somehow costs $450,000 by the time you add everything you actually need to live in it.</p>

        <p>At CORELOT, we think about affordability differently. It's not just about the upfront price tag—it's about total cost of ownership, realistic budgeting, and building a home that fits comfortably within your financial life. Let's break down what that actually means.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Affordability Starts With Honest Numbers</h2>
        <p>The foundation of true affordability is knowing what things actually cost—not fantasy numbers designed to get you in the door.</p>

        <p>When we talk about project budgets, we include everything: land acquisition, site work, construction, permits, utility connections, landscaping, and a realistic contingency. We don't quote you a house price and then act surprised when you need a driveway, a septic system, and trees cleared.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>The Real Cost of Homeownership</h3>
          <p>True affordability means understanding three numbers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Upfront costs:</strong> Land, construction, site work, permits, and closing costs</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly costs:</strong> Mortgage, insurance, taxes, and utilities</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term costs:</strong> Maintenance, repairs, and eventual replacements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A home is only affordable if all three of these fit comfortably in your budget—not just the first one.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We've seen too many people stretch to afford the purchase price of a home, only to struggle with the monthly payments or defer necessary maintenance because there's no money left. That's not affordable. That's financial stress disguised as homeownership.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Building Affordability Into Design</h2>
        <p>Smart design can make a home significantly more affordable without making it feel cheap or compromised. This is where builder experience really matters.</p>

        <p><strong>Efficient floor plans reduce construction costs.</strong> A well-designed 1,800-square-foot home can feel more spacious and functional than a poorly designed 2,200-square-foot home. We focus on making every square foot work hard—reducing wasted space like oversized hallways or awkward room proportions that add cost without adding value.</p>

        <p><strong>Simple roof lines save money.</strong> Complex roof designs with multiple valleys, dormers, and pitch changes look impressive, but they're expensive to build and more prone to maintenance issues. A straightforward roof can be both attractive and budget-friendly.</p>

        <p><strong>Strategic material choices matter.</strong> There's often a sweet spot where you're getting excellent quality without paying for a luxury brand name. We help you identify those opportunities—places where you can save without sacrificing durability or appearance.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Example: Main Floor Primary Suite</h3>
          <p>Many clients want their primary bedroom on the main floor for long-term livability. But adding square footage to the main level increases foundation and roof costs significantly.</p>
          <p>An affordable solution? Design a home where the upstairs is mostly bonus/flex space you can finish later. You get the main-floor primary you want now, with the option to expand upstairs as budget and needs allow. Smart design creates affordability and flexibility.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Energy Efficiency Is Affordability</h2>
        <p>Here's something many builders won't tell you: the cheapest house to build is often the most expensive house to own.</p>

        <p>When you cut corners on insulation, windows, and HVAC systems to hit a lower purchase price, you're committing to higher utility bills for the entire life of the home. Over 30 years of homeownership, those savings evaporate many times over.</p>

        <p>We build energy efficiency into every CORELOT home as standard practice—not as an expensive upgrade. This includes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Proper insulation in walls, attic, and foundation</li>
          <li>Quality windows with low-E coatings</li>
          <li>Air sealing to prevent drafts and energy loss</li>
          <li>Right-sized, efficient HVAC systems</li>
          <li>Thoughtful orientation to leverage natural light and shade</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The upfront cost difference is modest. The monthly savings are substantial. And the comfort improvement is immediate. That's what makes a home truly affordable to own.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Low Maintenance = Long-Term Affordability</h2>
        <p>Affordability doesn't end when you close on the house. It extends into every year you live there.</p>

        <p>We make material recommendations with long-term maintenance in mind. Fiber cement siding costs more than vinyl upfront, but it lasts decades longer and doesn't need replacement. Metal roofs have a higher initial cost than asphalt shingles, but they might outlast the mortgage itself.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the "affordable" choice now becomes the expensive choice later. We help you understand those trade-offs so you can make informed decisions based on your situation. If you plan to stay in the home for 30 years, long-term durability might matter more than initial cost. If you're building a starter home you'll outgrow in 10 years, a different calculation might make sense.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>The 10-Year Test</h3>
          <p>When evaluating material choices, we ask: "What will this cost to maintain over 10 years?" Paint that needs recoating every 5 years vs. every 15 years. Flooring that wears out vs. flooring that ages gracefully. Those ongoing costs add up.</p>
          <p>True affordability factors in the full lifecycle, not just the installation price.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Financing Impacts Affordability</h2>
        <p>How you finance your home dramatically affects affordability. A slightly higher interest rate can add hundreds to your monthly payment. A construction-to-permanent loan can save you thousands in closing costs compared to separate construction and mortgage loans.</p>

        <p>We work with lenders who understand custom homebuilding and can structure financing that works for your situation. We also help you understand how different down payment amounts, loan terms, and financing structures impact your monthly budget.</p>

        <p>Affordability isn't just about qualifying for a loan—it's about ensuring the payment fits comfortably in your budget with room for life's other priorities and unexpected expenses.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">

        <h2>The Affordability Conversation</h2>
        <p>Every CORELOT project starts with an honest conversation about budget. We need to know what you can comfortably afford—not what you can technically qualify for, but what works for your life.</p>

        <p>From there, we design a home that fits. Sometimes that means starting smaller and planning for future additions. Sometimes it means prioritizing certain features and being more economical elsewhere. Sometimes it means waiting another year to save more down payment.</p>

        <p>We're here to help you make smart decisions, not to push you into a home that stretches your finances to the breaking point. True affordability means sleeping well at night, knowing your home fits your life—not stresses it.</p>
