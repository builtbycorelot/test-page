        <h1>The CORELOT Design Process</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">How we transform your vision into construction-ready plans at the Jefferson Barn studio</p>
      </div>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Design is a Conversation, Not a Transaction</h2>
        <p>We don't hand you a catalog and ask you to pick a model. We don't rush you through a one-hour "design meeting" with a salesperson who's never held a framing hammer. Our design process is fundamentally different because we believe great homes come from great conversations.</p>

        <p>At CORELOT, design happens at our Jefferson Barn studio—a workspace that blends old-school craftsmanship with modern technology. It's where we sit down with you, learn about how you actually live, and translate those insights into a home plan that works specifically for you.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Phase 1: Discovery & Vision</h2>
        <p>Every project starts with listening. In our first meetings, we're not talking about square footage or bathroom counts—we're asking deeper questions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>How do you use your current home?</strong> What works? What drives you crazy?</li>
          <li><strong>What's your daily routine?</strong> Do you work from home? Cook every night? Entertain frequently?</li>
          <li><strong>What are your priorities?</strong> Natural light? Storage? Open flow? Private spaces?</li>
          <li><strong>Who else needs to be accommodated?</strong> Growing kids? Aging parents? Hobbies that need space?</li>
          <li><strong>What's your lot like?</strong> Views to capture? Slopes to work with? Trees worth saving?</li>
          <li><strong>What's your realistic budget?</strong> Let's be honest about numbers from day one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These conversations might seem basic, but they're the foundation of everything. A floor plan that looks beautiful in a magazine might be completely wrong for how you actually live. We need to understand your life before we can design a home for it.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Phase 2: Conceptual Design</h2>
        <p>Once we understand your vision, we start sketching. We might begin with one of our existing plans and modify it, or we might start from scratch. Either way, the process is collaborative.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>We Start With Pencil and Paper</h3>
          <p>In an era of instant 3D renderings, we still believe in sketching by hand first. Why? Because rough sketches are easy to change. They encourage experimentation. "What if we moved this wall?" "Could we flip the garage?" "What about adding a window here?"</p>
          <p>Sketches keep the conversation flowing without getting bogged down in details prematurely. Once we've nailed down the basic concept, then we move to precision.</p>
        </div>

        <p>During this phase, we're constantly balancing three factors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Does the layout work for your lifestyle?</li>
          <li><strong>Site fit:</strong> Does the home work with your specific lot?</li>
          <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Can we build this within your means?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We'll explore multiple concepts, showing you different approaches. Maybe one maximizes main-floor living while another prioritizes upstairs space. We're not trying to sell you on our favorite—we're helping you discover what works best for you.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Phase 3: 3D Visualization & Refinement</h2>
        <p>Once we've settled on a conceptual direction, we move into our 3D design software. This is where the plan comes to life.</p>

        <p>We'll create detailed 3D renderings that let you "walk through" your future home on screen. You'll see how rooms relate to each other, how ceiling heights feel, where natural light enters throughout the day, and how the home sits on your lot.</p>

        <p>This is also where builder experience becomes invaluable. We're not just designers—we're builders who understand construction. As we refine your plan, we're thinking about:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Structural efficiency (avoiding unnecessary complexity that drives up cost)</li>
          <li>Material optimization (smart design can reduce waste)</li>
          <li>Long-term maintenance (some choices look great but create headaches)</li>
          <li>Energy performance (orientation, window placement, insulation details)</li>
          <li>Future flexibility (can spaces adapt as your needs change?)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We'll iterate on the design multiple times, incorporating your feedback at each step. This is your home—we won't move forward until you're confident it's right.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Phase 4: Material & Finish Selections</h2>
        <p>With the floor plan locked in, we shift to selections—the finishes, fixtures, and materials that give your home its character.</p>

        <p>At the Jefferson Barn, we maintain a library of samples: flooring, countertops, cabinetry, tile, hardware, lighting. You can see and touch everything. We'll explain the pros and cons of different choices, both aesthetically and practically.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>We Help You Balance Wants and Budget</h3>
          <p>Here's where honest conversation matters. If you love a particular countertop but it's going to blow your budget, we'll tell you. We'll also suggest alternatives that achieve a similar look for less, or we'll help you decide what to prioritize.</p>
          <p>Our job is to educate you on options and implications, then support whatever decisions you make. There's no judgment—just guidance.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Selections typically happen in phases. We'll start with structural elements (roof materials, siding, windows), then move to interior finishes. We time these decisions to align with construction schedules, so you're not overwhelmed all at once.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Phase 5: Construction Documents</h2>
        <p>Once design and selections are finalized, we prepare construction documents—the detailed blueprints and specifications needed for permitting and building.</p>

        <p>These documents include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Architectural floor plans and elevations</li>
          <li>Foundation and structural details</li>
          <li>Electrical and plumbing layouts</li>
          <li>HVAC design</li>
          <li>Material specifications</li>
          <li>Energy code compliance documentation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We handle all permit submissions and coordinate with engineers, septic designers, surveyors, and other professionals as needed. You don't have to navigate bureaucracy—that's on us.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Phase 6: Pre-Construction Review</h2>
        <p>Before breaking ground, we'll meet with you one final time to review everything. We'll walk through the complete plan set, answer any lingering questions, confirm final selections, and ensure everyone is aligned.</p>

        <p>This is also when we review the construction timeline and communication expectations. You'll know what to expect at each phase, how we'll keep you updated, and how to reach us with questions or concerns.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>What Makes Our Process Different</h2>
        <p>If you've shopped other builders, you might notice some differences in our approach:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>We Don't Rush You</h3>
          <p>Good design takes time. We'd rather spend weeks getting it right than rush to break ground with a plan that doesn't fully work. Most clients appreciate having time to think through decisions rather than feeling pressured.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>We're Transparent About Costs</h3>
          <p>As design evolves, so does pricing. We provide updated cost estimates throughout the process so you always know where you stand financially. No surprises at the end.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>We Design With Construction in Mind</h3>
          <p>Because we're builders, not just designers, we create plans that are actually buildable. We avoid details that look pretty on paper but create problems in the field. We design homes that our crews can build efficiently without compromising quality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>We Educate as We Go</h3>
          <p>For most people, building a custom home is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. We treat it as our responsibility to help you understand what you're deciding and why it matters. You'll leave the process knowing more about homebuilding than you ever expected.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>How Long Does Design Take?</h2>
        <p>It varies, but most clients spend 2-4 months on design, from initial consultation through permitted plans. If you're starting with an existing plan and making minor modifications, it might be faster. If you're creating something completely custom or dealing with a complex site, it might take longer.</p>

        <p>We're more interested in getting it right than hitting arbitrary deadlines. That said, we're also not going to drag things out unnecessarily. We'll work at whatever pace makes sense for your project and schedule.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Can You Design Without Building?</h2>
        <p>Generally, no. Our design process is integrated with our construction services. We're not an architecture firm—we're a design-build company. Our value is in creating plans that we then bring to life with our own construction team.</p>

        <p>If you already have plans from another source, we're happy to review them and provide a construction bid. But if you need design work, we expect to build what we design.</p>
