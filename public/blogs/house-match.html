        <h2>Square Footage Doesn't Tell the Whole Story</h2>
        <p>We've met couples who swear they need 3,000 square feet, only to realize after talking through how they actually live that 2,200 square feet designed well would serve them better. We've worked with others who thought 1,800 square feet would be enough, then discovered they really needed closer to 2,500 once they accounted for their actual lifestyle.</p>

        <p>The problem with house hunting—whether you're looking at existing plans or browsing online—is that we tend to focus on numbers that don't actually predict whether a house will work for us. Square footage. Bedroom count. Bathroom count. These matter, but they're not the whole picture.</p>

        <p>What really matters is match: Does this house match how you live? Does the layout support your daily routines? Does the space allocation reflect your actual priorities? Does it fit your lot? Does it align with your realistic budget?</p>

        <p>Let's talk about how to find or create that match.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Start With How You Actually Live</h2>
        <p>Before you look at a single floor plan, spend time thinking honestly about your daily life and priorities.</p>

        <h3>Your Daily Routines</h3>
        <p>Walk through a typical day. Where do you spend your time? What creates friction in your current home? What works well?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Do you cook most nights, or is the kitchen mostly for reheating and coffee?</li>
          <li>Where do you spend evenings—kitchen table, living room, separate spaces?</li>
          <li>Do you work from home? Need dedicated office space?</li>
          <li>Do you entertain frequently or rarely?</li>
          <li>What's your morning routine look like? Any bathroom bottlenecks?</li>
          <li>Where does clutter accumulate? Do you have enough storage?</li>
          <li>How do you use outdoor space?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These aren't hypothetical questions. We're asking about what actually happens, not what you aspire to happen. If you've never used a formal dining room, you probably don't need one. If you work from home every day, you definitely need office space.</p>

        <h3>Your Household Composition</h3>
        <p>Who lives in your home now? How might that change in 5-10 years?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Kids at home? How many? What ages? How long until they're launched?</li>
          <li>Planning to have children or add to your family?</li>
          <li>Aging parents who might move in someday?</li>
          <li>Frequent overnight guests?</li>
          <li>Home-based business or hobbies requiring space?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You're not building for right now—you're building for the next chapter of your life. Think about where you'll be in five years, not where you are today.</p>

        <h3>Your Priorities and Values</h3>
        <p>What actually matters to you in a home?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Natural light and views? Big windows, specific orientations?</li>
          <li>Open flow for togetherness? Or defined rooms for privacy?</li>
          <li>Main-floor living for aging-in-place? Or bedrooms upstairs for separation?</li>
          <li>Large kitchen for cooking? Or minimal kitchen with big living areas?</li>
          <li>Home gym, workshop, craft room, music space?</li>
          <li>Low-maintenance or room for DIY projects?</li>
          <li>Energy efficiency and long-term operating costs?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Write It Down</h3>
          <p>Seriously. Make a list of must-haves, strong preferences, and nice-to-haves. This becomes your filter when evaluating plans. A plan might be beautiful, but if it doesn't check your must-have boxes, it's the wrong plan.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Floor Plan Layouts</h2>
        <p>Once you know what you need, you can evaluate whether specific floor plans deliver it.</p>

        <h3>Open vs. Defined Floor Plans</h3>
        <p><strong>Open concept:</strong> Kitchen, dining, and living areas flow together without walls. Great for families with young kids, entertainers, people who like togetherness. Can feel less cozy, offer less privacy, and make noise control challenging.</p>

        <p><strong>Defined rooms:</strong> Distinct spaces separated by walls and doors. Better for privacy, noise control, formal entertaining. Can feel more traditional, requires more square footage for hallways and transitions.</p>

        <p>Most modern homes split the difference: open main living areas with some defined spaces like home offices, formal dining, or separate sitting rooms.</p>

        <h3>Single-Story vs. Two-Story</h3>
        <p><strong>Ranch (single-story):</strong> Everything on one level. Great for accessibility, easier aging-in-place, strong indoor-outdoor flow. Requires a wider lot footprint, more roof and foundation per square foot (higher cost per square foot), but eliminates stairs and simplifies HVAC.</p>

        <p><strong>Two-story:</strong> Bedrooms upstairs, living spaces downstairs (typically). More efficient use of smaller lots, lower cost per square foot, natural separation between public and private spaces. Requires stairs (accessibility concern), can have HVAC balancing challenges, less indoor-outdoor flow from upper level.</p>

        <p><strong>Main-floor master:</strong> Master suite on main level with additional bedrooms upstairs. Bridges both approaches—you can age in place while kids are upstairs. Popular middle ground.</p>

        <h3>Garage Relationships</h3>
        <p>How your garage connects to your home affects daily life more than you might think.</p>

        <p><strong>Direct entry:</strong> Walk straight from garage into mudroom or hallway. Most convenient for groceries, weather protection, daily flow. Standard in attached garages.</p>

        <p><strong>Through the house:</strong> Garage entrance goes through kitchen or living areas. Less ideal—you're dragging everything through main living spaces.</p>

        <p><strong>Separate/detached:</strong> Garage is not attached to the house. Requires outdoor travel but provides separation. Works when lot layout demands it or when garage doubles as workshop.</p>

        <h3>Master Suite Considerations</h3>
        <p>Your master bedroom and bathroom get used every single day. They deserve attention.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Room for a king bed plus dressers, sitting area, walk-in closet?</li>
          <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Separated from other bedrooms? Not next to main living areas?</li>
          <li><strong>Bathroom size:</strong> Double vanity? Separate shower and tub? Toilet privacy?</li>
          <li><strong>Closet:</strong> Walk-in? How much hanging vs. shelf space? Built-in organizers?</li>
          <li><strong>Natural light:</strong> Windows positioned for morning light or privacy?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These details vary dramatically between plans, even plans with the same overall square footage. Pay attention.</p>

        <h2>Matching Plans to Your Lot</h2>
        <p>A perfect floor plan becomes imperfect fast if it doesn't work with your lot.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Bring Your Survey to the Conversation</h3>
          <p>If you own your lot, we need to see the survey, topography, and any site constraints. Many plans we look at will require modifications to work with your specific site. Some won't work at all without major redesign. Better to know this upfront.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Lot width:</strong> Ranch plans need width. Two-story plans can fit narrower lots. Know your buildable width after setbacks.</p>

        <p><strong>Slope:</strong> Steep slopes might require walkout basement designs or homes built into the hillside. Flat lots give you more flexibility.</p>

        <p><strong>Orientation:</strong> Can you position the plan to capture views, sunlight, and privacy? Some plans are flexible, others work best in specific orientations.</p>

        <p><strong>Access and driveways:</strong> Where will the driveway come in? Does the garage position work with your access point?</p>

        <p>We can modify almost any plan to work with most lots, but modifications take time and add design costs. The closer the plan fits your lot naturally, the smoother the process.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Budget Reality Check</h2>
        <p>The right house match also means matching your budget reality.</p>

        <h3>Construction Cost Factors</h3>
        <p>Two homes with identical square footage can have very different construction costs based on design complexity.</p>

        <p><strong>Simple shapes cost less:</strong> Rectangular homes with simple rooflines cost less to build than homes with complex angles, multiple roof planes, and intricate details.</p>

        <p><strong>Story count matters:</strong> Two-story homes cost less per square foot than ranch homes (you're building one foundation and one roof for twice the space).</p>

        <p><strong>Finishes and features:</strong> Vaulted ceilings, large windows, stone or brick exteriors, high-end finishes—these all add cost.</p>

        <p><strong>Special features:</strong> Covered porches, three-car garages, bonus rooms, finished basements—they add value but also add cost.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>We'll Give You Real Numbers</h3>
          <p>As you look at different plans, we'll provide realistic cost estimates based on current construction costs and your specific lot conditions. You'll never fall in love with a plan only to discover it's 30% over budget.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Right-Sizing vs. Maxing Out</h3>
        <p>Just because you can afford to build 3,000 square feet doesn't mean you should. Consider:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>More square footage = higher heating/cooling costs forever</li>
          <li>More space = more to clean, maintain, furnish, and repair</li>
          <li>Building slightly smaller might allow for better finishes or lot selection</li>
          <li>Unused space doesn't add value to your life</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We've had clients decide to build smaller than their budget allowed and use the savings for upgrades they'll enjoy daily—better kitchen, nicer flooring, covered porch, landscaping. That's smart allocation.</p>

        <h2>Starting Points: Existing Plans vs. Custom Design</h2>
        <p>You don't have to start from a blank page, but you're also not limited to building exactly what someone else designed.</p>

        <h3>Starting With Our Plans</h3>
        <p>We have a collection of proven floor plans that we've built successfully. These give you a starting point that you can modify.</p>

        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Proven layouts, established pricing, faster design timeline, can see photos of built examples.</p>

        <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> We can modify plans—flip layouts, adjust room sizes, add or remove features, change exterior styles. Most clients start with a plan and customize it.</p>

        <h3>Custom Design</h3>
        <p>Sometimes your needs, lot, or vision require starting fresh.</p>

        <p><strong>Best when:</strong> Your lot has unique characteristics, you have very specific requirements, existing plans don't come close to what you need.</p>

        <p><strong>Process:</strong> Takes longer (2-4 months typically), more design meetings, higher design costs, but results in a home tailored exactly to your situation.</p>

        <h3>The Middle Ground</h3>
        <p>Most projects fall between these extremes. Start with a plan you like 70-80% of the way there, then modify it to become 100% right for you. This combines the efficiency of existing plans with the customization you need.</p>

        <h2>Red Flags: When a Plan Isn't the Right Match</h2>
        <p>As you evaluate plans, watch for these warning signs:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Trust Your Gut on These</h3>
          <p><strong>Wasted space:</strong> Long hallways, awkward nooks, rooms you can't picture using. Space should be functional, not just square footage.</p>
          <p><strong>Traffic flow problems:</strong> Do you have to walk through bedrooms to reach bathrooms? Does the front door open directly into the living room? Is the kitchen isolated from where people gather?</p>
          <p><strong>Inadequate storage:</strong> Count closets, pantry space, linen storage. Where will everything actually go?</p>
          <p><strong>Bathroom logistics:</strong> Morning bottlenecks? Kids sharing bathrooms with guests? Master bath without privacy?</p>
          <p><strong>"We can make it work" mentality:</strong> If you're talking yourself into a plan rather than genuinely excited about it, keep looking.</p>

        <h2>How We Help You Find Your Match</h2>
        <p>At CORELOT, finding the right house match is a collaborative process. Here's how we approach it:</p>

        <p><strong>1. We listen first:</strong> Before showing you plans, we want to understand your life, your lot, your budget, and your priorities.</p>

        <p><strong>2. We show you options:</strong> Based on what we've learned, we'll suggest several plans that might work—from our existing designs or custom concepts.</p>

        <p><strong>3. We walk through each one:</strong> Not just "here's the floor plan" but "here's how this would work for your morning routine, your entertaining style, your lot orientation."</p>

        <p><strong>4. We create 3D visualizations:</strong> You'll see what the space actually feels like, how rooms relate, how it sits on your lot.</p>

        <p><strong>5. We discuss modifications:</strong> What would make a good plan even better? What's worth changing? What would changes cost?</p>

        <p><strong>6. We provide honest feedback:</strong> If we think you're over-building or under-building for your needs, we'll say so. If a plan won't work well with your lot, we'll explain why.</p>

        <p>Our goal isn't to sell you a plan—it's to help you find or create the right match. We'd rather spend extra time in design getting it right than rush to construction with a plan that doesn't fully work.</p>
