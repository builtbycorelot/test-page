        <h2>Your Safety Net: Understanding Warranties</h2>
        <p>A warranty is your protection against defects and problems that shouldn't occur in a properly built home. It's our commitment to stand behind our work and make things right if issues arise.</p>

        <p>But warranties can be confusing. What's covered? For how long? What's your responsibility versus ours? How do you submit a claim? Understanding these details gives you peace of mind and helps you budget appropriately for homeownership costs.</p>

        <p>Let's break down exactly what warranty coverage means, what you should expect to maintain as a homeowner, and how quality construction affects long-term costs.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>CORELOT's Warranty Coverage</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>One-Year Workmanship and Materials Coverage</h3>
          <p>For the first year after closing, we warrant all workmanship and materials against defects. This covers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Construction defects or workmanship errors</li>
            <li>Material failures (excluding manufacturer defects, which are covered separately)</li>
            <li>Issues arising from improper installation</li>
            <li>Defects in finishes, trim, paint, or other completed work</li>
            <li>Plumbing or electrical problems related to installation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If something wasn't done right or fails due to our error, we fix it. Period. This is your comprehensive coverage for the critical first year when you're discovering how everything works.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Two-Year Mechanical Systems Coverage</h3>
          <p>HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems are covered for two years against defects in materials and workmanship. This extended coverage recognizes that these systems are critical to your home's function and comfort.</p>
          <p>Additionally, all mechanical equipment (furnaces, air conditioners, water heaters, etc.) carries manufacturer warranties that typically range from 5-10 years. We provide all manufacturer warranty documentation and registration information at closing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Ten-Year Structural Coverage</h3>
          <p>The structural components of your home—foundation, framing, roof structure—are warranted for ten years against major defects that affect the home's structural integrity or safety.</p>
          <p>This doesn't mean your roof shingles last ten years (they have their own lifespan), but it means the roof structure itself won't fail due to construction defects. Same for the foundation: settlement cracks might occur (that's normal), but structural failure from improper construction is covered.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Manufacturer Warranties</h3>
          <p>Beyond our coverage, many components carry manufacturer warranties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Roofing materials: typically 25-50 years depending on product</li>
            <li>Windows and doors: typically 10-20 years</li>
            <li>Siding: typically 25-50 years for material defects</li>
            <li>Appliances: typically 1-5 years depending on brand and product</li>
            <li>HVAC equipment: typically 5-10 years</li>
            <li>Water heaters: typically 6-12 years</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We provide all warranty documentation and help you understand what's covered by whom.</p>

        <h2>What's NOT Covered: Normal Homeowner Maintenance</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Understanding the Difference</h3>
          <p>Warranties cover defects and failures—things that shouldn't happen with proper construction and materials. They don't cover normal wear and tear, lack of maintenance, or damage from accidents or misuse.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Here's what falls under your responsibility as a homeowner:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Regular Maintenance Items</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>HVAC filter changes:</strong> Monthly or quarterly depending on filter type and usage</li>
            <li><strong>Caulking and sealants:</strong> Periodic inspection and touch-up, especially around windows, doors, and wet areas</li>
            <li><strong>Paint touch-ups:</strong> Normal wear from use, furniture contact, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Gutter cleaning:</strong> Seasonal clearing of leaves and debris</li>
            <li><strong>Lawn and landscaping:</strong> All yard maintenance and irrigation</li>
            <li><strong>Appliance cleaning:</strong> Routine cleaning and maintenance per manufacturer guidelines</li>
            <li><strong>Weather stripping:</strong> Replacement as it wears from normal use</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Normal Settlement and Seasonal Changes</h3>
          <p>New homes settle slightly as they adjust. Minor hairline cracks in drywall, small gaps at trim joints, or minor floor squeaks can appear in the first year. These are typically normal and easily addressed with simple touch-ups.</p>
          <p>Wood materials expand and contract with seasonal humidity changes. Doors might fit differently in summer versus winter. Gaps at trim joints might appear as lumber dries. These are characteristics of natural materials, not defects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Damage vs. Defects</h3>
          <p>Warranties don't cover damage from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accidents (dropped items, moving furniture, etc.)</li>
            <li>Neglect or lack of maintenance</li>
            <li>Alterations or modifications you make</li>
            <li>Acts of nature (storms, flooding, etc.)—that's what homeowners insurance covers</li>
            <li>Normal wear from use</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The key distinction: If something fails because we did it wrong, we fix it. If it needs attention because you own a home and homes require maintenance, that's on you. We'll help you understand which is which.</p>

        <h2>How to Submit a Warranty Claim</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Our Simple Process</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Contact us:</strong> Call, email, or submit through our website. Describe the issue and include photos if possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial response:</strong> We respond within 2 business days to acknowledge your claim and ask any clarifying questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> For non-emergency items, we typically schedule a site visit within 7-10 days. For emergencies (water leaks, HVAC failure in extreme weather, etc.), we respond immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Determination:</strong> We assess whether the issue is warranty-covered or falls under normal maintenance. We explain our reasoning either way.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> If covered, we schedule and complete repairs promptly. If it's maintenance, we can often handle it anyway for a reasonable service fee, or guide you on DIY approaches.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Emergency vs. Non-Emergency</h3>
          <p><strong>Emergencies</strong> (immediate response): Active water leaks, complete HVAC failure in extreme temperatures, electrical hazards, structural safety concerns.</p>
          <p><strong>Non-emergencies</strong> (scheduled response): Minor leaks, cosmetic issues, squeaks, minor cracks, single fixture problems, etc.</p>
          <p>We triage appropriately to ensure urgent issues get immediate attention while efficiently scheduling routine items.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Budgeting for Homeownership Costs</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>First-Year Expectations</h3>
          <p>In a new home's first year, your maintenance costs should be minimal. You're covered by warranty, systems are new, and nothing should need replacement. Budget for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HVAC filters: $100-$200 annually</li>
            <li>Routine cleaning and supplies: $200-$400</li>
            <li>Lawn care and landscaping: varies widely based on lot size and your approach</li>
            <li>Potential minor repairs or adjustments: $200-$500</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Total non-landscape maintenance: typically $500-$1,000 for the first year.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Years 2-5: Establishing Routines</h3>
          <p>As warranty coverage phases out, you assume more responsibility, but systems are still new. Budget for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Annual HVAC service: $150-$250</li>
            <li>Filters, cleaning, routine maintenance: $300-$500</li>
            <li>Minor repairs and adjustments: $300-$600</li>
            <li>Possible appliance repairs: $200-$400</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Total: typically $1,000-$2,000 annually, excluding major landscaping.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Years 5-10: Longer-Term Planning</h3>
          <p>Nothing major should fail yet, but you're approaching the lifespan of some components. Budget for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Regular maintenance (HVAC, cleaning, etc.): $500-$800</li>
            <li>Minor repairs and replacements: $500-$1,000</li>
            <li>Potential water heater replacement (8-12 year lifespan): $1,200-$2,000</li>
            <li>Possible appliance replacement: $500-$2,000 if needed</li>
            <li>Exterior painting or staining (if needed): $3,000-$8,000 around year 8-10</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Annual average: $1,500-$2,500, with some years higher if major items need replacement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>The 1% Rule</h3>
          <p>A common guideline suggests budgeting 1% of your home's value annually for maintenance and repairs. For a $400,000 home, that's $4,000 per year. This seems high early on but evens out over time as you eventually face roof replacement, HVAC replacement, and other major items.</p>
          <p>In reality, new home costs are lower initially and increase as the home ages. But setting aside funds consistently prevents financial stress when bigger expenses eventually arise.</p>

        <h2>How Quality Construction Reduces Long-Term Costs</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>The True Value of Quality</h3>
          <p>Quality construction isn't just about immediate satisfaction—it's about reducing costs and headaches over decades of ownership. Here's how our approach saves you money long-term:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Proper Techniques Prevent Problems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Correct flashing:</strong> Prevents water intrusion that causes rot, mold, and expensive repairs</li>
            <li><strong>Quality insulation:</strong> Reduces energy costs year after year; savings compound over decades</li>
            <li><strong>Proper drainage:</strong> Prevents foundation problems, basement moisture, and erosion</li>
            <li><strong>Code-plus framing:</strong> Eliminates squeaks, settling, and structural issues</li>
            <li><strong>Quality HVAC installation:</strong> Systems run more efficiently and last longer when properly sized and installed</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Quality Materials Last Longer</h3>
          <p>The delta between cheap and quality materials is often modest upfront but massive over time:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Quality shingles might cost 20% more but last 50% longer</li>
            <li>Better windows reduce energy costs 15-25% annually forever</li>
            <li>Quality fixtures don't fail, requiring replacement and hassle</li>
            <li>Better paint coverage means fewer repainting cycles</li>
            <li>Quality flooring withstands wear far better than budget alternatives</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Energy Efficiency Compounds</h3>
          <p>A well-insulated, properly sealed home with efficient systems saves $100-$300 monthly compared to code-minimum construction. Over 30 years, that's $36,000-$108,000 in savings. The extra cost to build it right? Usually $5,000-$15,000. The return on investment is dramatic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Fewer Surprises, Less Stress</h3>
          <p>Beyond dollar costs, quality construction reduces the likelihood of unexpected failures, emergency repairs, and the stress of dealing with problems. A home built right simply requires less attention, freeing you to enjoy living in it rather than constantly maintaining it.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Warranties</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>"What if I sell before warranty expires?"</h3>
          <p>Our warranty typically transfers to subsequent owners for the remainder of the coverage period. This can be a selling point, as buyers appreciate purchasing a home with remaining warranty protection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>"What if we modify or add to the home?"</h3>
          <p>Modifications don't void the entire warranty, but we're not responsible for issues arising from changes you or others make. If you add a deck and it causes drainage issues, that's not our responsibility. But if the original foundation develops problems, it's still covered.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>"Can we extend warranty coverage?"</h3>
          <p>Extended warranties or home service contracts are available from third-party providers. We can provide information, but these are separate from our builder warranty. Many homeowners find them valuable for peace of mind, especially on major systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>"What if there's a dispute about coverage?"</h3>
          <p>We're committed to fair treatment and open communication. If you disagree with our assessment, we'll explain our reasoning and consider getting a third-party expert opinion if appropriate. Our goal is resolution, not argument.</p>

        <h2>Maintenance Tips for New Homeowners</h2>
        <p>A few simple habits will keep your home in great condition and minimize long-term costs:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Change HVAC filters regularly:</strong> This single habit extends system life and maintains efficiency</li>
          <li><strong>Clean gutters seasonally:</strong> Prevents water damage and foundation problems</li>
          <li><strong>Check caulking annually:</strong> A $5 tube of caulk prevents $5,000 water damage repairs</li>
          <li><strong>Service HVAC annually:</strong> Preventive maintenance is far cheaper than emergency repairs</li>
          <li><strong>Address small issues promptly:</strong> A minor leak becomes major damage if ignored</li>
          <li><strong>Keep records:</strong> Document maintenance, repairs, and when things were replaced</li>
          <li><strong>Understand your systems:</strong> Read manuals, know where shutoffs are, understand basic operation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We provide a homeowner manual at closing with maintenance schedules, product information, and guidance on caring for your specific home.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Our Commitment Beyond Warranty</h2>
        <p>While warranties have defined coverage periods, our commitment to you doesn't end when they expire. We remain available to answer questions, provide guidance, or help with issues even years after closing.</p>

        <p>Many of our clients call us with questions about additions, renovations, or maintenance issues years later. We're happy to help because we care about your long-term satisfaction and because we build homes we're proud of.</p>

        <p>That's the real warranty: not just the legal coverage period, but the ongoing relationship and accountability that comes from building homes the right way for people we respect.</p>
