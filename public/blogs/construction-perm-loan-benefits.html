        <h2>The Financing Headache Most Builders Won't Talk About</h2>
        <p>Here's a scenario that plays out constantly in custom homebuilding: You've found your lot, selected a floor plan, and you're ready to build. You go to the bank to discuss financing, and you learn you'll need two separate loans—a construction loan to fund the build, then a permanent mortgage after completion.</p>

        <p>That means two applications, two approval processes, two sets of closing costs, two interest rate negotiations, and the risk that something could go wrong between construction completion and mortgage approval.</p>

        <p>There's a better way: construction-to-permanent loans (often called "one-close" or "single-close" loans). These streamline the entire financing process into a single transaction. At CORELOT, we work with lenders who specialize in these loans because we've seen firsthand how much stress and expense they save our clients.</p>

        <p>Let's break down how they work and why they might be the right choice for your project.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>How Construction-to-Permanent Loans Work</h2>
        <p>A construction-to-permanent loan combines two separate loans into one seamless package:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Phase 1: Construction Phase</h3>
          <p>During construction (typically 6-12 months), the loan functions as a construction loan. The lender disburses funds in stages (called "draws") as work progresses. You typically pay interest only on the amount drawn so far, not the full loan amount.</p>
          <p>For example, after the foundation is complete, the lender releases funds to cover that phase. You pay interest only on that amount until the next draw.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Phase 2: Automatic Conversion</h3>
          <p>Once construction is complete and you receive your certificate of occupancy, the loan automatically converts to a traditional mortgage. There's no second closing, no second application, no second round of fees. The interest-only payments end, and you begin regular principal and interest payments.</p>
          <p>The transition happens seamlessly—usually you just start receiving normal mortgage statements instead of construction loan statements.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The beauty of this structure is that you're locked into your mortgage terms from day one. Your interest rate, loan term, and monthly payment are set before construction even begins.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Key Benefits of One-Close Financing</h2>
        <p>Construction-to-permanent loans offer several significant advantages over traditional two-loan structures:</p>

        <h3>1. One Closing Saves Thousands</h3>
        <p>Closings aren't free. Title work, attorney fees, appraisal fees, origination fees, and other closing costs typically run $3,000-$8,000 or more. With traditional financing, you pay these costs twice—once for the construction loan, again for the permanent mortgage.</p>

        <p>With a one-close loan, you pay closing costs once. On a $400,000 project, this can easily save $4,000-$6,000.</p>

        <h3>2. Rate Lock Protection</h3>
        <p>Here's a risk many people don't consider with two-loan financing: interest rates can change during construction. If rates rise significantly between when you start building and when you finish, your permanent mortgage might cost substantially more than you budgeted.</p>

        <p>Construction-to-permanent loans lock your rate at the beginning. You know exactly what your payment will be before breaking ground. No surprises, no rate risk.</p>

        <p>In a rising rate environment, this protection is incredibly valuable. We've seen situations where rates increased 1-2% during construction—that could mean hundreds of dollars more in monthly payments for the life of the loan.</p>

        <h3>3. Simplified Approval Process</h3>
        <p>You apply once, get approved once, and you're done. You don't need to requalify for a mortgage after construction completes. This is particularly helpful if your financial situation might change during the build—maybe you're changing jobs, starting a business, or planning other life changes that could complicate loan approval.</p>

        <p>With traditional two-loan financing, you need to qualify for the permanent mortgage later, after construction. If your income has changed, your credit score has dipped, or your debt-to-income ratio shifted, you could face problems getting approved for the mortgage—even though your house is already built.</p>

        <h3>4. Lower Stress, Less Paperwork</h3>
        <p>Building a custom home involves enough moving parts without doubling your financing complexity. One application, one approval, one set of paperwork. You can focus on construction decisions rather than loan administration.</p>

        <h3>5. Interest-Only Construction Payments</h3>
        <p>During construction, you only pay interest on funds actually disbursed. This keeps payments manageable while you're likely still paying rent or a mortgage on your current home.</p>

        <p>For example, if you have a $400,000 loan at 7% interest but only $100,000 has been drawn so far, you're paying interest on $100,000, not $400,000. Your payment might be $580/month instead of $2,330/month.</p>

        <p>Once you move in and the loan converts to a mortgage, you begin full principal-and-interest payments—but by then, you're no longer paying for your previous housing.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>How the Draw Process Works</h2>
        <p>Understanding the construction draw process helps demystify how funds are released during your build:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Work is completed to a certain phase</strong> (foundation, framing, rough-in, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>We submit a draw request</strong> to the lender with documentation of completed work</li>
          <li><strong>The lender inspects the work</strong> (usually through a third-party inspector) to verify completion</li>
          <li><strong>Funds are released</strong> to pay for the completed work</li>
          <li><strong>The process repeats</strong> through each phase of construction</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Most construction-to-permanent loans involve 4-6 draws over the course of the project. The lender wants to ensure funds are being used appropriately and that work is progressing as planned.</p>

        <p>We handle the draw request process—you don't need to become an expert in construction financing. But it helps to understand the basic flow so you know what to expect.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Who Qualifies for Construction-to-Permanent Loans?</h2>
        <p>Qualification requirements are similar to conventional mortgage requirements, with a few additional considerations:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Typical Requirements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit score:</strong> Usually 680 or higher (some lenders require 700+)</li>
            <li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Typically 10-20%, though some programs allow less</li>
            <li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Generally below 43-45%</li>
            <li><strong>Income documentation:</strong> Tax returns, pay stubs, employment verification</li>
            <li><strong>Detailed construction plans and budget:</strong> The lender needs to understand what's being built and what it will cost</li>
            <li><strong>Builder approval:</strong> Most lenders require you to work with a licensed, insured builder (like CORELOT) with a track record of completing projects</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Because we're an established builder with a history of successful projects, lenders are comfortable working with our clients. They know we'll complete the home on time and within budget, which reduces their risk.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Are There Downsides?</h2>
        <p>Construction-to-permanent loans aren't perfect for every situation. Here are scenarios where they might not be the best fit:</p>

        <p><strong>You have access to cash for construction.</strong> If you can pay for construction outright and then take out a traditional mortgage after completion, you might get a slightly better mortgage rate. But you're tying up significant capital for months.</p>

        <p><strong>Interest rates are falling.</strong> If rates are declining, locking in at the beginning of construction means you can't take advantage of lower rates later. However, predicting rate movements is difficult, and the risk cuts both ways.</p>

        <p><strong>Your lender doesn't offer them.</strong> Not all banks provide construction-to-permanent loans. If you're committed to a specific lender who doesn't offer them, you'll need traditional two-loan financing.</p>

        <p>For most clients, though, the benefits significantly outweigh these potential drawbacks.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>VA and USDA Construction-to-Permanent Loans</h2>
        <p>If you're eligible for VA or USDA financing, construction-to-permanent loans are available through those programs too:</p>

        <p><strong>VA Construction Loans</strong> offer the same one-close benefit with VA loan advantages: no down payment required (in most cases), no PMI, and competitive rates. This is an excellent option for veterans and active-duty service members building custom homes.</p>

        <p><strong>USDA Construction Loans</strong> are available in eligible rural areas (which includes much of our building region). They offer 100% financing with no down payment for qualifying buyers in designated areas.</p>

        <p>We work with lenders experienced in these specialized programs and can help you understand if you qualify.</p>

        <ul>

          <li><strong>Draw management:</strong> We handle draw requests throughout construction, making the process seamless</li>
          <li><strong>Budget accuracy:</strong> Our detailed cost estimates help ensure the loan amount is appropriate—not too little (leaving you short) or too much (paying interest on unused funds)</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline reliability:</strong> We keep projects on schedule, which prevents extended construction periods that increase interest costs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Good communication between builder and lender makes construction-to-permanent loans work smoothly. We've developed these relationships over years, which benefits our clients.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>If you're considering building a custom home, talk to a lender about construction-to-permanent loans early in the process—ideally before you even finalize plans.</p>

        <p>Getting pre-approved helps you understand what you can afford, locks in your financing structure, and removes uncertainty from the planning process. You'll know your budget, your rate, and your future payment before making major decisions about home design.</p>

        <p>We're happy to introduce you to lenders we trust, or you can shop on your own. Either way, understanding your financing options before you start designing makes the entire process smoother.</p>
