        <h2>Building From Experience, Not Just Plans</h2>
        <p>We didn't start CORELOT Homes in a boardroom. We started it with our hands.</p>

        <p>Our founders came from the trades—framing, concrete, electrical, plumbing. We spent years on job sites, learning what actually makes a home last. We saw shortcuts that would come back to haunt homeowners years later. We witnessed the frustration when builders prioritized speed over quality, or when communication disappeared the moment a contract was signed.</p>

        <p>Those experiences shaped everything we do today. When we founded CORELOT in 2009, we made a promise: we would build the kind of homes we'd want to live in ourselves, using the methods we'd want used if we were the customer.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>What CORELOT Stands For</h2>
        <p>Our name reflects our core belief: the <strong>lot comes first</strong>. Before we talk about granite countertops or vaulted ceilings, we help you find or evaluate the right piece of land. A beautiful home on the wrong lot is a missed opportunity. The right lot, thoughtfully developed, becomes the foundation for everything else.</p>

        <p>We're not just builders—we're partners in the entire process. From initial lot search through final walkthrough and beyond, we're here to guide, educate, and deliver. We believe homebuilding should be approachable, transparent, and even enjoyable.</p>

        <h2>Our Core Values in Practice</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>1. Integrity in the Small Things</h3>
          <p>Integrity isn't just about the big decisions—it's in the details most people never see. It's properly flashing a window, even though it's hidden behind siding. It's using the right fasteners, not just the cheapest ones. It's calling out a potential issue before it becomes a problem.</p>
          <p>We believe that if we do the small things right, the big things take care of themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>2. Transparent, Honest Pricing</h3>
          <p>We've all heard horror stories about construction budgets that balloon out of control. That's why we provide clear, itemized pricing from the start. We explain what things cost and why. We don't hide margin in inflated allowances or surprise you with "unforeseen" expenses that were entirely foreseeable.</p>
          <p>Our goal is that you understand exactly where your money goes—and that you feel confident in the value you're receiving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>3. Personal Guidance, Every Step</h3>
          <p>Building a custom home can feel overwhelming, especially if it's your first time. We treat education as part of our job. We'll explain why we recommend certain products or methods. We'll walk you through decisions at a pace that works for you. We're available to answer questions, big or small.</p>
          <p>You're not just a project number to us—you're someone we're helping achieve a major life goal.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>4. Community Connection</h3>
          <p>We build primarily in Fredericksburg, Stafford, and Spotsylvania—communities we know well and care about deeply. Many of our team members live in the area. We see our work every day, which keeps us accountable. We want to be proud of what we build, because it's part of the neighborhood fabric.</p>
          <p>We're not here to build and disappear. We're here for the long term, building relationships as much as homes.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p>Every project is different, but our approach remains consistent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Listen first.</strong> We start by understanding your vision, budget, and timeline. What matters most to you? What are your non-negotiables? What's flexible?</li>
          <li><strong>Design collaboratively.</strong> Whether you're starting with one of our plans or creating something custom, we work together to refine the design until it's exactly right.</li>
          <li><strong>Build with care.</strong> Our construction process emphasizes quality at every phase. We inspect our own work. We keep job sites clean and organized. We treat your project like it's our own home.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate proactively.</strong> You'll never wonder what's happening. We provide regular updates, respond quickly to questions, and keep you informed throughout the process.</li>
          <li><strong>Stand behind our work.</strong> Our relationship doesn't end at closing. We provide comprehensive warranty coverage and remain available to address any concerns.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
        <p>The homebuilding industry has its share of problems—poor communication, hidden costs, corner-cutting, and builders who prioritize volume over quality. We've seen it all, and we've intentionally built our business differently.</p>

        <p>We're not trying to be the biggest builder in Virginia. We're trying to be the best partner for people who value quality, honesty, and a builder who actually cares about the outcome. We limit the number of projects we take on so we can give each one the attention it deserves.</p>

        <p>We measure success not by how many homes we build, but by how many happy homeowners we create. Our best marketing has always been word-of-mouth referrals from satisfied clients—and that's exactly how we want it.</p>

        <h2>The Jefferson Barn: Where Ideas Become Plans</h2>
        <p>Our design studio, housed in a restored barn structure, reflects our philosophy. It's a working space where we combine old-school craftsmanship with modern technology. We sketch ideas on actual paper. We use 3D software to visualize concepts. We pull out material samples so you can see and touch what we're talking about.</p>

        <p>It's a place where conversations happen, decisions are made, and dreams start taking shape. If you're considering building with CORELOT, we'd love to have you visit. Bring your ideas, your questions, and your wish list. Let's talk about what's possible.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
        <p>If you choose to build with CORELOT, here's what we promise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We'll be honest with you, even when it's uncomfortable</li>
          <li>We'll build your home like we're building our own</li>
          <li>We'll communicate clearly and respond promptly</li>
          <li>We'll respect your budget and timeline</li>
          <li>We'll educate you throughout the process</li>
          <li>We'll stand behind our work long after closing</li>
          <li>We'll treat you the way we'd want to be treated</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These aren't marketing slogans—they're operational principles that guide every decision we make.</p>
