        <h1>Lot Feasibility: Will This Land Actually Work?</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">Essential questions to ask before purchasing land for your custom home</p>
      </div>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Not Every Lot Is Buildable</h2>
        <p>You've found what looks like the perfect lot. Great price, beautiful setting, exactly where you want to be. Before you get too excited, we need to answer one critical question: Can you actually build on it?</p>

        <p>We've had heartbreaking conversations with people who bought land without doing feasibility work, only to discover their dream lot has unbuildable soils, restrictive setbacks that make their desired house impossible, or utility connections that would cost more than the land itself.</p>

        <p>Lot feasibility assessment isn't about being pessimistic—it's about being informed. Most lots are buildable with proper planning. Some require creative solutions or additional investment. A few genuinely won't work for residential construction. The key is knowing which category your lot falls into before you own it.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>The Core Feasibility Questions</h2>
        <p>Every lot evaluation should answer these fundamental questions:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>The Five Critical Factors</h3>
          <p><strong>1. Can you legally build here?</strong> Zoning, deed restrictions, easements, and setbacks.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Will the soil support your home?</strong> Foundation capacity and septic suitability.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Can you get utilities?</strong> Water, sewer/septic, electric, gas access and costs.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Is the site physically workable?</strong> Topography, drainage, access, and site development costs.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Are there environmental constraints?</strong> Wetlands, flood zones, protected species, critical areas.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Let's dig into each of these in detail.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Legal and Regulatory Feasibility</h2>

        <h3>Zoning Review</h3>
        <p>Start at the county or municipal planning office. You need to know:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Zoning classification:</strong> Is residential construction allowed? Any restrictions on home type or size?</li>
          <li><strong>Minimum lot size:</strong> Does your parcel meet the minimum size for building?</li>
          <li><strong>Setback requirements:</strong> How far from property lines must your home be? Front, side, and rear setbacks all matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Building height restrictions:</strong> Are there limits on home height or stories?</li>
          <li><strong>Coverage limits:</strong> Some areas limit how much of the lot can be covered by structures and impervious surfaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Setbacks are particularly important. A one-acre lot sounds spacious, but if setbacks require 50 feet from front, 30 feet from sides, and 40 feet from rear, your actual buildable area shrinks significantly. Make sure your desired house plan fits within these constraints.</p>

        <h3>Deed Restrictions and Covenants</h3>
        <p>Review all deed restrictions, HOA covenants, and neighborhood agreements. These private restrictions can be more limiting than public zoning.</p>

        <p>Look for requirements or restrictions on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimum home size (square footage requirements)</li>
          <li>Architectural style or design approval processes</li>
          <li>Exterior materials and colors</li>
          <li>Outbuildings, garages, sheds</li>
          <li>Fencing, landscaping</li>
          <li>Construction timelines (must build within X years)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We've seen covenants that mandate brick exteriors, require 3,000 square foot minimums, or prohibit metal roofing. Know these restrictions before purchasing.</p>

        <h3>Easements</h3>
        <p>Check the survey for easements—rights others have to use portions of your property.</p>

        <p><strong>Utility easements:</strong> Common along property edges for power lines, water/sewer mains. Usually don't prevent building, but you can't build within the easement area.</p>

        <p><strong>Access easements:</strong> Giving neighbors or others the right to cross your property. Consider how this affects privacy and home placement.</p>

        <p><strong>Drainage easements:</strong> Areas reserved for stormwater management. Can significantly impact buildable area.</p>

        <p>Large or poorly placed easements can make a lot effectively unbuildable even if it's legally allowed.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Soil and Septic Feasibility</h2>
        <p>If public sewer isn't available, soil quality becomes critical—you need suitable soils for a septic system.</p>

        <h3>Perc Test (Percolation Test)</h3>
        <p>This test measures how quickly water drains through the soil. Your county health department typically requires a perc test before approving a septic system.</p>

        <p><strong>What happens:</strong> Holes are dug, filled with water, and drainage rate is measured. This determines what type of septic system you can install and where it can be located.</p>

        <p><strong>Good perc:</strong> Water drains at an acceptable rate, standard septic system works, moderate cost.</p>

        <p><strong>Poor perc:</strong> Water drains too slowly. Might require expensive alternative systems—mound systems, sand filters, aerobic treatment units. Could add $15,000-$40,000+ to septic costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Failed perc:</strong> Soils won't support any septic system. Lot might be unbuildable unless public sewer can be extended (usually very expensive).</p>

        <h3>Soil Bearing Capacity</h3>
        <p>Can the soil support your home's foundation? Most residential soils are fine, but some areas have weak soils, high water tables, or other concerns.</p>

        <p>For problem soils, solutions exist—helical piles, over-excavation and replacement, specialized foundations—but they add significant cost. A geotechnical engineer can assess this.</p>

        <h3>When to Order Soil Tests</h3>
        <p>Include soil testing contingencies in your purchase offer. Don't own the land before you know it will support your plans.</p>

        <p>Many sellers have recent perc tests or soil evaluations they can share. If the lot hasn't been tested, make your offer contingent on satisfactory soil tests.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Utility Feasibility</h2>
        <p>How will your home get water, handle wastewater, and receive power?</p>

        <h3>Water Supply</h3>
        <p><strong>Public water available:</strong> Contact the provider to confirm service availability, connection costs ($2,000-$10,000+ depending on distance), tap fees, and timeline. Some areas have water connection moratoriums or waiting lists.</p>

        <p><strong>Well required:</strong> Is the lot in a good well area? Talk to neighbors about their well depths and yields. Budget $8,000-$15,000+ for drilling, though costs vary by depth and geology. Not all wells produce adequate water—include well drilling contingencies in your offer.</p>

        <h3>Wastewater</h3>
        <p><strong>Public sewer available:</strong> Confirm with provider, get connection cost estimates, verify no capacity issues in the area.</p>

        <p><strong>Septic required:</strong> See soil feasibility section above. You'll need adequate area for both the drain field and replacement drain field (required by code). Factor in setback requirements from wells, property lines, surface water, and the house.</p>

        <h3>Electric Service</h3>
        <p>Contact the power company before purchasing. Questions to ask:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is service available to the lot?</li>
          <li>How far is the nearest transformer or service point?</li>
          <li>What will connection cost? (Distance is key—$1,500-$2,000 for close service, $10,000+ for distant connections)</li>
          <li>Underground or overhead service? (Underground costs more but looks better)</li>
          <li>What's the timeline for connection?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Utilities</h3>
        <p><strong>Natural gas:</strong> Available in some areas, not others. Propane is always an option but requires tank installation and delivery access.</p>

        <p><strong>Internet/communications:</strong> Increasingly important. Check availability of high-speed internet, cell service. Some rural lots have limited options.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Get Everything in Writing</h3>
          <p>Don't rely on "it should be available" or "we think we can connect." Get written confirmation from utility providers about availability, costs, and timelines before committing to land purchase.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Topography and Site Development</h2>
        <p>The physical characteristics of the land determine how much site work will be required.</p>

        <h3>Slope and Grading</h3>
        <p>Walk the lot carefully. Visualize where your house would sit.</p>

        <p><strong>Gentle slope (0-10%):</strong> Ideal. Minimal grading required, good for most foundation types, straightforward construction.</p>

        <p><strong>Moderate slope (10-20%):</strong> Workable but requires careful planning. Might need cut/fill, retaining walls, or walkout basement design. Still reasonable costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Steep slope (20%+):</strong> Challenging and expensive. Requires specialized design, likely needs significant retaining walls, extended driveways, specialized foundations. Get professional cost estimates before proceeding.</p>

        <p>For complex sites, a topographic survey is essential. This shows exact elevations and slopes, allowing accurate planning and cost estimation.</p>

        <h3>Drainage</h3>
        <p>Where does water go when it rains? Walk the lot during or after rain if possible.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Does water pond or sit in areas? (Indicates poor drainage or high water table)</li>
          <li>Are there natural drainage paths across the lot? (Your house shouldn't block these)</li>
          <li>Do neighboring properties drain onto this lot? (Could require drainage management)</li>
          <li>Any evidence of erosion? (Indicates water management challenges)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Poor drainage can usually be managed with proper grading and drainage systems, but it adds cost.</p>

        <h3>Access and Driveway</h3>
        <p>How will you reach your homesite?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Does the lot have road frontage, or is access via shared driveway or easement?</li>
          <li>What condition is the existing road? (Paved, gravel, dirt, seasonal?)</li>
          <li>How long will the driveway be? (Length = cost)</li>
          <li>What's the slope of the driveway route? (Steep = more expensive, winter challenges)</li>
          <li>Are there any access restrictions or requirements in deeds or covenants?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Trees and Clearing</h3>
        <p>Wooded lots are beautiful but require clearing for the house, driveway, and septic area.</p>

        <p>Walk through and estimate what clearing will be needed. Light clearing might be $3,000-$5,000. Heavy clearing of large trees over large areas can reach $15,000+.</p>

        <p>Check for protected trees or vegetation. Some areas restrict removal of certain species or sizes.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Environmental and Regulatory Constraints</h2>

        <h3>Wetlands</h3>
        <p>Wetlands are federally protected. You generally cannot build on them or alter them without permits (which are difficult to obtain).</p>

        <p>Red flags include standing water, cattails, certain plants, or wet, spongy soil. If you suspect wetlands, hire a qualified wetland specialist to delineate them before purchasing.</p>

        <p>Wetland buffers can also restrict building. You might not be able to build within 50-100 feet of wetland boundaries.</p>

        <h3>Flood Zones</h3>
        <p>Check FEMA flood maps for your lot. Building in flood zones is possible but requires expensive flood insurance and elevated foundations.</p>

        <p>If any portion of the lot is in a flood zone, verify that the buildable area (where you'd actually place the house) is outside the zone.</p>

        <h3>Critical Areas</h3>
        <p>Many jurisdictions have critical areas ordinances protecting steep slopes, wildlife habitat, aquifer recharge areas, or critical species habitat.</p>

        <p>Building in or near critical areas may require special studies, reports, and mitigation—all adding cost and complexity.</p>

        <h3>Historical or Archaeological Resources</h3>
        <p>Rare, but worth checking. Some areas have protections for archaeological sites or historical resources that can limit or prevent development.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>The Feasibility Study Process</h2>
        <p>Here's how a proper lot feasibility study works:</p>

        <h3>Phase 1: Desktop Research</h3>
        <p>Before even visiting the lot, we research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Zoning and comprehensive plan designation</li>
          <li>Flood maps and wetland inventory</li>
          <li>Existing surveys or plat maps</li>
          <li>Utility availability (calls to providers)</li>
          <li>Critical areas designations</li>
          <li>Available soil maps and geological data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This initial research often identifies deal-breakers without spending money on site visits or testing.</p>

        <h3>Phase 2: Site Visit</h3>
        <p>Walking the lot with experienced eyes. We're looking at topography, drainage, vegetation, access, neighboring properties, and evidence of any issues.</p>

        <p>This visit typically includes rough measurements, photos, and notes about opportunities and constraints.</p>

        <h3>Phase 3: Testing and Engineering</h3>
        <p>If Phase 1 and 2 look promising, we move to professional testing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perc test and soil evaluation (if septic needed)</li>
          <li>Topographic survey (for complex sites)</li>
          <li>Wetland delineation (if suspected)</li>
          <li>Geotechnical study (if soil concerns)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This phase costs money ($2,000-$8,000+ depending on what's needed), but it provides definitive answers.</p>

        <h3>Phase 4: Conceptual Planning</h3>
        <p>With all information gathered, we develop a conceptual site plan showing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where the house would sit</li>
          <li>Driveway route and length</li>
          <li>Septic system location (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Well location (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Required grading or retaining walls</li>
          <li>Utility connection points</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This plan allows accurate cost estimation for site development and confirms the lot works for your vision.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Making the Purchase Decision</h2>
        <p>After feasibility assessment, you'll fall into one of several categories:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Green Light: Proceed with Confidence</h3>
          <p>No significant issues identified. Development costs are reasonable and within budget. The lot works well for your desired home. Move forward.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Yellow Light: Proceed with Adjustments</h3>
          <p>Some challenges identified, but workable solutions exist. Might require design adjustments, additional budget for site work, or creative problem-solving. Decide if the lot is worth the extra effort and cost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Red Light: Walk Away</h3>
          <p>Fatal flaws identified—truly unbuildable soils, insurmountable zoning restrictions, prohibitive development costs, environmental constraints that can't be overcome. Save yourself future heartache and find a different lot.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Most lots fall into the yellow category. Perfect lots are rare. The question is whether the compromises or additional costs are acceptable given your budget and priorities.</p>
