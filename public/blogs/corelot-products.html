      </div>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Materials Matter More Than You Think</h2>
        <p>Walk through any new home and you'll see nice countertops, attractive flooring, and modern fixtures. What you won't see—but what matters most—is what's hidden behind the walls, under the floors, and in the attic.</p>

        <p>The difference between a home that lasts 30 years and one that lasts 100 years isn't the cabinet hardware. It's the quality of the framing lumber, the waterproofing details, the insulation package, and a thousand other decisions that most homeowners never see or think about.</p>

        <p>At CORELOT, we're particular about what goes into our homes. Not because we're trying to upsell expensive products, but because we've seen what fails prematurely and what stands the test of time. We build homes we'd be proud to live in ourselves, and that starts with choosing materials that perform.</p>

        <p>Let's walk through some of the key materials and products we use, and why we've chosen them.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Structural Materials: The Foundation of Quality</h2>
        <p>The bones of your home—foundation, framing, and sheathing—determine its long-term durability. This is where we refuse to compromise.</p>

        <h3>Foundation Systems</h3>
        <p>We primarily use poured concrete foundations with proper reinforcement. Concrete is mixed to spec, poured correctly, and given adequate curing time. We don't rush foundation work to meet arbitrary schedules.</p>

        <p>Before pouring, we install vapor barriers, drain systems, and waterproofing membranes appropriate for your site conditions. A dry basement or crawl space starts with proper foundation preparation—not with dealing with moisture problems later.</p>

        <h3>Framing Lumber</h3>
        <p>We use kiln-dried framing lumber properly graded for structural use. This matters because wet or green lumber shrinks as it dries, causing nail pops, drywall cracks, and other issues months after construction.</p>

        <p>All our framing is installed per code and engineered plans. We use appropriate fasteners, proper spacing, and correct techniques. Basic stuff, but not every builder takes the time to do it right.</p>

        <h3>Structural Sheathing</h3>
        <p>We sheath exterior walls with either OSB or plywood rated for structural use, properly attached with correct nailing patterns. We use ZIP System sheathing or house wrap systems to create a weather-resistant barrier that keeps water out while allowing vapor to escape.</p>

        <p>These details matter because water intrusion is one of the primary causes of long-term building failure. We take it seriously.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Energy Efficiency Package</h2>
        <p>We build energy efficiency into every home as standard practice, not as an expensive upgrade. This reduces your lifetime ownership costs and improves comfort.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Insulation</h3>
          <p>We exceed minimum code requirements for insulation. Typical packages include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walls:</strong> R-15 to R-21 depending on framing and method</li>
            <li><strong>Attics:</strong> R-38 to R-49 blown-in fiberglass or cellulose</li>
            <li><strong>Foundations:</strong> Insulated per code for your foundation type</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also emphasize air sealing—closing gaps and cracks that allow conditioned air to escape. Insulation only works if air can't bypass it.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Windows and Doors</h3>
        <p>We install vinyl or aluminum-clad wood windows with Low-E glass coatings and argon fills for improved energy performance. These reduce heat transfer, lower UV exposure (protecting your furniture and floors), and reduce outside noise.</p>

        <p>Exterior doors are insulated steel or fiberglass units with proper weatherstripping. We install them correctly with appropriate flashing and air sealing.</p>

        <h3>HVAC Systems</h3>
        <p>We work with reputable HVAC contractors to design and install properly-sized heating and cooling systems. Bigger isn't better—right-sized systems run more efficiently and provide better comfort.</p>

        <p>We install systems with appropriate SEER ratings for our climate, ensure ductwork is properly sealed, and include programmable or smart thermostats for better control.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Exterior Materials: Weather Protection</h2>
        <p>Your home's exterior is its first line of defense against weather. We use materials that protect effectively and last.</p>

        <h3>Roofing</h3>
        <p>Most of our homes feature architectural shingles with 30-50 year warranties. We also offer metal roofing for clients who want even longer service life and different aesthetics.</p>

        <p>Beyond the shingles themselves, proper underlayment, ventilation, and flashing details determine how well a roof performs. We don't shortcut these critical elements.</p>

        <h3>Siding</h3>
        <p>We offer several siding options, all chosen for durability and low maintenance:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fiber cement (like James Hardie):</strong> Extremely durable, rot and insect resistant, holds paint well, 30-50 year product life</li>
          <li><strong>Vinyl:</strong> Lower cost, virtually maintenance-free, good durability in our climate</li>
          <li><strong>Brick or stone:</strong> Premium appearance and durability, minimal maintenance</li>
          <li><strong>Board and batten or other architectural details:</strong> Available as accents or full coverage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We properly flash all penetrations, install siding per manufacturer specs, and ensure proper drainage planes behind the siding. Details matter.</p>

        <h3>Gutters and Downspouts</h3>
        <p>We install seamless aluminum gutters with proper hangers and pitch. Gutters seem basic, but they're critical for directing water away from your foundation. We size them appropriately for your roof and install enough downspouts to handle water volume.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Interior Finishes: Quality You Can See</h2>
        <p>This is where your personal preferences really come into play. We offer options at different price points, all chosen for quality within their range.</p>

        <h3>Flooring</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hardwood:</strong> Solid or engineered hardwood in various species and finishes</li>
          <li><strong>LVP (Luxury Vinyl Plank):</strong> Extremely durable, water-resistant, wide range of styles</li>
          <li><strong>Tile:</strong> Ceramic or porcelain for bathrooms, kitchens, entries</li>
          <li><strong>Carpet:</strong> Quality nylon or polyester in bedrooms and living areas</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We help you understand the trade-offs between options—appearance, durability, maintenance, and cost—so you can make informed choices.</p>

        <h3>Cabinetry</h3>
        <p>We work with cabinet manufacturers who build quality products—plywood box construction, dovetailed drawers, quality hardware, durable finishes. You choose style and finish; we ensure construction quality.</p>

        <p>We also emphasize functional design: adequate storage, good ergonomics, thoughtful organization. Pretty cabinets that don't function well aren't good cabinets.</p>

        <h3>Countertops</h3>
        <p>We offer granite, quartz, and solid surface countertops. Each has pros and cons:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Granite:</strong> Natural stone, unique patterns, requires periodic sealing</li>
          <li><strong>Quartz:</strong> Engineered stone, consistent appearance, no sealing needed, extremely durable</li>
          <li><strong>Solid surface:</strong> Repairable, seamless appearance, less expensive than stone</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We help you understand what works for your budget and use patterns.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Plumbing and Electrical: Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>These systems are critical to daily function but largely invisible. We use quality products installed by licensed, experienced tradespeople.</p>

        <h3>Plumbing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>PEX or copper supply lines (both are excellent; we use what makes sense for your project)</li>
          <li>PVC drain and waste lines</li>
          <li>Quality fixtures from manufacturers like Moen, Delta, or Kohler</li>
          <li>Proper venting and drain slopes for reliable function</li>
          <li>Water heaters sized appropriately for your household (tank or tankless)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Electrical</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>200-amp service minimum for modern electrical needs</li>
          <li>Quality panel boxes and breakers</li>
          <li>Copper wiring throughout</li>
          <li>AFCI and GFCI protection per current code</li>
          <li>Adequate outlets and lighting per your needs</li>
          <li>Structured wiring for internet, cable, and phone as desired</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Why We Choose What We Choose</h2>
        <p>Our material selections follow a few core principles:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Proven Performance</h3>
          <p>We use materials with track records. We're not interested in being beta testers for unproven products. If something has been performing well for 20+ years, we trust it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Appropriate for Our Climate</h3>
          <p>Virginia's climate—hot humid summers, freeze-thaw cycles in winter—requires specific material choices. What works in Arizona might fail here. We choose products suited to our region.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Value, Not Just Price</h3>
          <p>Cheapest isn't always best. We look for the sweet spot where quality, durability, and cost intersect. Sometimes that means spending more upfront for better long-term performance. Sometimes it means choosing a mid-range product that performs 95% as well as the premium version at 60% of the cost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Availability and Support</h3>
          <p>We work with suppliers and manufacturers who stand behind their products, offer good warranties, and are available when we need them. This matters when issues arise or when you need replacements years down the road.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Your Input Matters</h2>
        <p>While we have standard specifications and preferred products, we're flexible. If you have experience with a product you love, or if you have specific needs or preferences, we'll discuss alternatives.</p>

        <p>Our job is to educate you on the implications of different choices—performance, maintenance, cost, lead times—and then support your decisions. It's your home, and we want you to love it.</p>

        <p>What we won't do is install products we believe will fail or cause problems. If you want something we think is a bad idea, we'll tell you honestly. You might decide to proceed anyway, but at least you'll do so with full information.</p>
