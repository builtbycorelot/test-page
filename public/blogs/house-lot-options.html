        <h2>Your Home Should Work With Your Land, Not Against It</h2>
        <p>We've seen it happen too many times: someone falls in love with a house plan without considering how it will actually sit on their specific lot. They imagine it perfectly positioned, facing the right direction, with the driveway in exactly the right spot. Then reality hits during design—the plan doesn't work with the slope, the garage ends up on the wrong side, the best views are blocked, or site work costs spiral out of control.</p>

        <p>The truth is that your lot and your house design are inseparable. Every decision you make about your home—foundation type, garage placement, number of stories, window configuration, entrance location—needs to account for what your lot can and should support.</p>

        <p>This isn't about compromise. It's about smart decision-making that results in a better home. When we work with your lot's natural characteristics instead of fighting them, you end up with a house that feels right in its setting, functions better, and costs less to build.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Foundation Options: More Than Just What's Below</h2>
        <p>Your foundation choice affects everything from your budget to how you use your home. Let's break down the main options and when each makes sense.</p>

        <h3>Slab Foundation</h3>
        <p>A concrete slab poured directly on prepared ground. Simple, cost-effective, and increasingly popular in our area.</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You have a relatively flat lot (or can economically make it flat), you don't need basement space, you want the most affordable foundation option, you're building a ranch-style home.</p>

        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Lower cost than other foundations, faster construction, no crawlspace maintenance, works well with radiant floor heating, good for accessibility (no steps into the home).</p>

        <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> No underfloor storage or mechanical space (everything goes in closets or garage), harder to run plumbing and electrical repairs, requires getting the lot grade right before pouring.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical cost impact:</strong> Generally the least expensive foundation option, though extensive site grading can reduce savings.</p>

        <h3>Crawlspace Foundation</h3>
        <p>A raised foundation with 2-4 feet of space beneath the home. The traditional approach in many parts of the country.</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You have a gently sloping lot, you need accessible space for plumbing and HVAC, you want some flexibility for future utility changes, standard excavation is straightforward.</p>

        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easy access to all utilities and systems, natural space for ductwork and plumbing, can provide some storage, adapts well to slight slopes, maintains good ventilation under the house.</p>

        <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Requires proper ventilation and moisture control, periodic inspections recommended, more expensive than slab, not usable living space.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical cost impact:</strong> Mid-range option, higher than slab but much less than full basement.</p>

        <h3>Basement Foundation</h3>
        <p>Full-height foundation walls creating usable space below the main floor. Popular in some regions, less common in others due to soil conditions and water tables.</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You have a sloping lot (especially good for walkout basements), you want maximum living space per lot footprint, you need serious storage or flexible space, soil and water table conditions are favorable.</p>

        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Significant additional square footage, potential for future finished living space, excellent storage, natural space for mechanicals, great for sloped lots with walkout potential.</p>

        <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Most expensive foundation option, requires proper waterproofing, may have moisture challenges, not suitable for all soil types or areas with high water tables.</p>

        <p><strong>Typical cost impact:</strong> Highest initial cost, but adds significant square footage. Walkout basements on sloping lots can be cost-effective.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>How We Help You Decide</h3>
          <p>We'll evaluate your specific lot conditions—slope, soil type, drainage patterns, access—and show you what foundation types make sense. We'll provide cost comparisons and help you understand the long-term implications of each choice. Sometimes the "cheap" option isn't actually cheap once you account for all factors.</p>

        <h2>Garage Placement and Configuration</h2>
        <p>Garage decisions are more complex than they first appear. You're thinking about daily convenience, street appeal, budget, and how the garage relates to your lot's driveway access.</p>

        <h3>Attached vs. Detached</h3>
        <p>Most people prefer attached garages for convenience—step directly into the home with groceries, no walking through weather. Detached garages make sense when lot configuration demands it, when you want visual separation from the home, or when you're building a garage workshop that's better separated.</p>

        <h3>Garage Position</h3>
        <p><strong>Front-loading garage:</strong> Faces the street. Most common and usually most cost-effective since it minimizes driveway length. Works well on standard lots. Some people dislike the visual dominance of garage doors on the front elevation.</p>

        <p><strong>Side-loading garage:</strong> Garage is parallel to the street, entered from the side. Improves front elevation appearance, requires a wider lot, may need longer driveway depending on setbacks.</p>

        <p><strong>Rear-loading garage:</strong> Accessed from behind the house, often via alley or extended driveway. Great for street appeal but requires specific lot configuration and driveway access. Can be expensive due to long driveway runs.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Driveway Length Matters</h3>
          <p>Every foot of driveway costs money to install and maintain. On sloping lots, long driveways can require extensive grading, retaining walls, or special paving to handle the slope. We'll help you balance convenience, aesthetics, and budget when positioning your garage.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Garage Size</h3>
        <p>Standard two-car garages (20' x 20') are tight for modern vehicles, especially trucks and SUVs. We typically recommend 24' x 24' minimum for a comfortable two-car garage with storage. Three-car garages (32' x 24' or larger) provide room for vehicles plus workshop or storage space.</p>

        <p>Consider what you'll actually keep in the garage: vehicles, lawn equipment, tools, sports gear, seasonal items. Size accordingly.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Home Orientation: Capturing Views and Light</h2>
        <p>How your home sits on your lot affects your daily living experience more than most people realize.</p>

        <h3>View Orientation</h3>
        <p>If your lot has desirable views—mountains, woods, water, fields—your home should be positioned to take advantage of them. This might mean flipping a floor plan, reconfiguring window locations, or adjusting the entire site plan.</p>

        <p>We've worked with lots where the "obvious" house placement would have put the main living areas facing away from the best views. A simple flip of the plan fixed everything.</p>

        <h3>Solar Orientation</h3>
        <p>In our climate, southern exposure brings valuable winter sunlight and warmth. Large south-facing windows can reduce heating costs. East-facing windows provide morning light. West-facing windows can create heat gain in summer and glare issues.</p>

        <p>We're not dogmatic about this—your lot's specific characteristics and your priorities determine the right approach—but it's worth considering during design.</p>

        <h3>Privacy and Setbacks</h3>
        <p>Position your home to maximize privacy from neighbors and roads while respecting setback requirements. Consider where your outdoor living spaces (decks, patios) will be and how they relate to neighboring properties.</p>

        <p>On narrow lots, side-facing windows might create privacy issues. On wooded lots, you might have flexibility to add windows anywhere. We'll walk your lot and adjacent properties to identify opportunities and potential problems.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Managing Slopes and Grading</h2>
        <p>Slope is one of the biggest factors affecting house design options and costs.</p>

        <h3>Flat Lots</h3>
        <p>Simple and straightforward. Any foundation type works. Slab is cost-effective. Main concern is ensuring proper drainage away from the foundation.</p>

        <h3>Gentle Slopes</h3>
        <p>Often ideal. Slope can work to your advantage for drainage and walkout potential. Crawlspace foundations adapt well. May allow for a walkout basement or daylight basement on the downhill side.</p>

        <h3>Steep Slopes</h3>
        <p>More challenging but can create dramatic opportunities. Often best suited for homes designed into the slope—walkout basements, split-level designs, or homes that step down the hillside. May require retaining walls, specialized foundations, or extended site work.</p>

        <p>Steep slopes significantly affect costs. What you save on a less expensive lot might be spent on site work, specialized foundations, longer driveways, and retaining structures.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Site Work Can Surprise You</h3>
          <p>We always recommend a topographic survey before finalizing house plans for sloped lots. What looks manageable might require extensive grading, fill, retaining walls, or drainage systems. Getting this information early prevents expensive surprises later.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Outdoor Living Spaces</h2>
        <p>Decks, patios, porches, and outdoor living areas should be planned as part of your overall design, not afterthoughts.</p>

        <p><strong>Covered porches:</strong> Front porches add curb appeal and functionality. Rear porches extend living space and provide weather protection. Include them in your initial plans for proper roof integration and foundation support.</p>

        <p><strong>Decks:</strong> Great for sloped lots where you need to build up to create level outdoor space. Consider access from main living areas. Think about privacy, views, and sun exposure. Budget for proper railings, stairs, and finishes.</p>

        <p><strong>Patios:</strong> Work well on flat or gently sloped lots. Can be added later more easily than decks, but planning during construction allows for better integration and grading.</p>

        <p>We'll help you decide what outdoor spaces to include in your initial build versus what you can add later. Sometimes it makes sense to rough in for future additions even if you're not building them immediately.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Window Placement: Balancing Light, Views, and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Windows deserve careful thought based on your specific lot conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>Maximize natural light:</strong> Especially important in main living areas, kitchens, and master bedrooms. Consider how rooms will feel at different times of day.</p>

        <p><strong>Frame views:</strong> Position windows to capture the best views your lot offers. Sometimes a single well-placed window is better than a wall of glass facing the wrong direction.</p>

        <p><strong>Maintain privacy:</strong> Avoid large windows on sides facing close neighbors. Consider window height and placement in bedrooms and bathrooms.</p>

        <p><strong>Manage energy:</strong> Large west-facing windows can create cooling challenges. North-facing windows provide consistent light without heat gain. South-facing windows offer winter solar gain.</p>

        <p>We'll create 3D renderings showing how window configurations look from inside and outside, helping you visualize the impact of different approaches.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Utilities and Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Boring but important: how will utilities reach your home?</p>

        <p><strong>Water and sewer:</strong> Connection points affect house placement. Long utility runs cost money. Gravity-flow septic systems have elevation requirements that might affect home positioning.</p>

        <p><strong>Power:</strong> Underground service looks better but costs more than overhead. Distance from power source affects connection costs.</p>

        <p><strong>Propane or natural gas:</strong> Tank placement for propane needs screening and access. Natural gas lines have distance considerations.</p>

        <p><strong>Well and septic:</strong> Placement requirements, setbacks from home and property lines, soil conditions, and test results all affect feasibility and location.</p>

        <p>We coordinate with utility providers, septic designers, and well drillers early in the process to ensure your house design accounts for all infrastructure requirements.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Keeping Options Within Budget</h2>
        <p>Every option has a price tag. Here's how to prioritize:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Spend Money Where It Matters</h3>
          <p><strong>Foundation choices:</strong> Right-sizing your foundation for your needs saves money. Don't build a basement if you'll never use it, but don't skip it if you really need the space.</p>
          <p><strong>Site work:</strong> Smart house placement minimizes grading, retaining walls, and driveway costs. A slightly different position might save thousands.</p>
          <p><strong>Window upgrades:</strong> Large specialty windows are expensive. Use them strategically where they provide maximum impact.</p>
          <p><strong>Garage size:</strong> Every additional foot adds cost. Size for realistic needs plus a little margin, not aspirational storage you'll never fill.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We'll show you cost implications of different options throughout the design process. You'll never be surprised by a number at the end—you'll make informed decisions along the way.</p>

        <h2>How We Approach House and Lot Integration</h2>
        <p>At CORELOT, we don't design homes in a vacuum. We start by walking your lot with you. We look at topography, drainage patterns, views, access points, neighboring properties, sun angles, and vegetation worth preserving.</p>

        <p>Then we discuss your priorities: What matters most to you? Views? Privacy? Minimizing site costs? Outdoor living space? Garage convenience? Natural light?</p>

        <p>From there, we develop house configurations that work specifically for your lot and your goals. We'll show you multiple approaches with honest assessments of trade-offs and costs.</p>

        <p>Our advantage is that we're builders, not just designers. We understand what different choices cost to implement. We know which details create problems in the field and which ones work smoothly. This practical knowledge saves you money and prevents headaches.</p>
