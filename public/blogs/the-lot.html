      </div>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Why the Lot Comes First</h2>
        <p>Our name says it all: CORELOT. The lot isn't just where you build—it's the foundation of every decision that follows. The right lot enhances your home's value, functionality, and enjoyment. The wrong lot creates ongoing challenges and compromises.</p>

        <p>We've seen beautiful homes diminished by poor lot selection: stunning views blocked by trees no one evaluated, drainage problems that could have been avoided, utility costs that ballooned because no one measured distances upfront. These aren't small issues—they're permanent characteristics that affect daily life and long-term value.</p>

        <p>That's why we start every project with careful lot evaluation. Whether you already own land or we're helping you search, understanding the property thoroughly allows us to design appropriately and price accurately. Let's explore what matters when evaluating a building site.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Soil Conditions: What You Can't See Matters Most</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Why Soil Matters</h3>
          <p>Soil determines what type of foundation you'll need, how much it will cost, and whether you'll face drainage problems. Poor soil can add tens of thousands to construction costs or create ongoing maintenance headaches.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Key Soil Considerations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bearing capacity:</strong> Can the soil support a standard foundation, or will you need deeper footings, piers, or special engineering?</li>
            <li><strong>Rock content:</strong> Excessive rock requires blasting or specialized excavation, increasing foundation costs significantly</li>
            <li><strong>Clay content:</strong> High clay content means expansion and contraction with moisture, requiring specific foundation design</li>
            <li><strong>Drainage characteristics:</strong> Does water percolate naturally, or does the soil hold water like a bathtub?</li>
            <li><strong>Fill or virgin soil:</strong> Compacted fill requires additional care; unknown fill can hide future settling issues</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>How We Evaluate Soil</h3>
          <p>We typically order a geotechnical analysis or soil test before finalizing plans. This involves drilling test borings to understand soil composition at various depths. The engineer's report tells us exactly what foundation approach will work and what to expect during excavation.</p>
          <p>This modest upfront investment prevents expensive surprises during construction. We'd rather know about rock or poor bearing capacity now and plan accordingly than discover it when the excavator shows up.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Don't buy a lot without understanding soil conditions, especially if you're comparing multiple properties. A cheaper lot with difficult soil often costs more overall than a slightly pricier lot with good conditions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Topography: Working With the Land</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Understanding Slope and Grade</h3>
          <p>Topography affects everything from foundation type to driveway design to where you can locate the home on the lot. Flat lots are simplest to build on but may have drainage challenges. Sloped lots offer opportunities but require more careful planning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Opportunities in Topography</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Walkout basements:</strong> Rear-sloping lots make basements functional living space with natural light and direct access</li>
            <li><strong>Elevated views:</strong> Building on the high part of a lot often provides better views and natural drainage</li>
            <li><strong>Natural drainage:</strong> Gentle slopes naturally move water away from the foundation</li>
            <li><strong>Tiered landscaping:</strong> Slopes create opportunities for terraced outdoor spaces and visual interest</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy advantages:</strong> Elevation changes can provide natural screening from neighbors</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Challenges in Topography</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grading costs:</strong> Significant slopes require more earthwork to create building pads and driveways</li>
            <li><strong>Retaining walls:</strong> Steep slopes may need retaining walls to manage grade changes safely</li>
            <li><strong>Driveway design:</strong> Steep or long driveways increase cost and require careful design for safe access</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation complexity:</strong> Sloped lots often require stepped footings or taller foundation walls</li>
            <li><strong>Utility routing:</strong> Topography affects how easily water, sewer, and utilities can reach the home</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Topography isn't good or bad—it's about understanding what you're working with and designing accordingly. We help you evaluate whether a particular lot's topography creates value or expense for your vision.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Utilities: Connection Costs and Considerations</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Water Supply</h3>
          <p>Will you connect to public water or need a well? Public connections typically cost $3,000-$8,000 depending on distance and tap fees. Wells cost $8,000-$15,000 depending on depth and flow requirements. Water quality and reliability differ significantly between sources.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Wastewater Management</h3>
          <p>Public sewer is ideal where available, with connection costs similar to water. Where public sewer isn't available, you'll need a septic system. Septic systems require percolation testing to confirm the soil can handle wastewater. Systems typically cost $8,000-$20,000 depending on soil conditions and required capacity.</p>
          <p>Some lots fail perc tests entirely, making them unbuildable without expensive alternative systems. This is why we test before you buy when possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Electrical Service</h3>
          <p>Distance to existing power lines affects connection costs. Bringing power to a remote lot can cost $10,000-$30,000 or more if significant distance or difficult terrain is involved. Underground service costs more than overhead but looks better and is more reliable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Natural Gas</h3>
          <p>Natural gas availability varies by location. Where unavailable, you'll use propane (requires tank installation and delivery access) or all-electric systems. This affects both construction costs and long-term operating expenses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Internet and Communication</h3>
          <p>Don't overlook connectivity. Some rural areas have limited high-speed internet options. If you work from home or have high bandwidth needs, confirm service availability before committing to a lot.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Utility connection costs can vary by $30,000 or more between lots. Get specifics before finalizing your purchase. We help you understand real costs, not just assumptions.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Access and Driveways</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Road Frontage and Access</h3>
          <p>How does the lot connect to public roads? Direct frontage on a public road is simplest. Lots accessed via easements or shared driveways require legal review to ensure you have permanent access rights and understand maintenance responsibilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Driveway Design Factors</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> Longer driveways cost more to install and maintain. Budget $15-$30 per linear foot for gravel, $30-$50 for asphalt</li>
            <li><strong>Slope:</strong> Steep driveways require careful design for safety and drainage, potentially increasing costs</li>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> Single-lane driveways are cheaper but less convenient; consider your household's needs</li>
            <li><strong>Turnaround space:</strong> Long driveways need turnarounds so you don't have to back out to the road</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance access:</strong> Can service vehicles (trash trucks, delivery trucks, emergency vehicles) safely access the property?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Factor driveway costs into your lot budget. A lot that's $20,000 cheaper but needs a $15,000 driveway isn't really cheaper—and the driveway cost isn't recoverable in home value.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Zoning, Setbacks, and Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Zoning Regulations</h3>
          <p>Zoning determines what you can build and how you can use the property. Residential zoning typically allows single-family homes, but specific requirements vary. Some zones restrict building height, architectural style, or lot coverage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Setback Requirements</h3>
          <p>Setbacks define how close to property lines you can build. Front, rear, and side setbacks vary by jurisdiction and zoning. These requirements affect where the house can be positioned and how much usable space remains for yards, driveways, and outbuildings.</p>
          <p>On smaller lots, setbacks can significantly constrain design options. Make sure the lot is large enough to accommodate your intended home plus required setbacks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>HOA and Deed Restrictions</h3>
          <p>Homeowners associations or deed restrictions may impose requirements beyond county zoning: minimum square footage, approved materials, architectural review processes, or restrictions on outbuildings, fencing, or landscaping.</p>
          <p>Review these carefully before buying. Some restrictions are reasonable; others may conflict with your vision for the property.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Easements and Encumbrances</h3>
          <p>Easements grant others rights to use portions of your property—utility companies, neighboring property owners, or public agencies. Common easements include utility lines, drainage, or access routes.</p>
          <p>Large easements can limit where you can build or landscape. Always review a survey showing easement locations before finalizing lot purchase.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Legal and regulatory constraints can make or break a lot's suitability. We help you navigate these issues before you're committed.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Trees, Views, and Natural Features</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Existing Trees</h3>
          <p>Mature trees add value and character but affect construction planning. We consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which trees to preserve and which must be cleared for construction</li>
            <li>Root protection zones during construction</li>
            <li>Tree health and potential hazards (dead trees, unstable specimens)</li>
            <li>Future growth and how it might affect views, sunlight, or structures</li>
            <li>Leaf management and maintenance requirements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Clearing costs vary, but budget $1,000-$3,000 per acre for selective clearing, more for heavy timber.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Views and Sight Lines</h3>
          <p>Views significantly affect property value and enjoyment. We evaluate:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What views exist now and from what elevations</li>
            <li>How home placement affects view capture</li>
            <li>Whether future development could block views</li>
            <li>How to orient the home to maximize desirable views while minimizing less attractive ones</li>
            <li>Window and deck placement to take advantage of views</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Natural Features to Preserve</h3>
          <p>Streams, rock outcroppings, specimen trees, and unique topographical features add character. Where possible, we incorporate these into the design rather than remove them. A beautiful boulder or creek can become a focal point that enhances your property's uniqueness.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Natural features are both opportunities and constraints. Walk the property carefully before buying. Visit at different times of day to understand light, views, and the actual character of the land.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Orientation and Solar Considerations</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Sun Path and Seasonal Changes</h3>
          <p>The sun's path affects heating, cooling, and natural light. South-facing windows provide excellent winter sun and light. East-facing windows capture morning sun. West-facing windows can create afternoon heat gain. North-facing windows provide consistent indirect light but little solar heat.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Designing for Climate</h3>
          <p>We consider orientation when siting your home:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maximize south-facing glass for passive solar gain in winter</li>
            <li>Use overhangs to shade south windows from high summer sun</li>
            <li>Minimize west-facing glass to reduce afternoon heat gain</li>
            <li>Position living spaces to capture morning or evening light based on your preferences</li>
            <li>Consider prevailing wind direction for natural ventilation</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Outdoor Space Orientation</h3>
          <p>Where will you place decks, patios, and outdoor living areas? Morning sun for breakfast on an east-facing deck? Afternoon shade for a west-facing patio? Evening sun for a south- or west-facing outdoor dining area? We help you plan outdoor spaces for how you'll actually use them.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Thoughtful orientation improves comfort, reduces energy costs, and enhances enjoyment. It costs nothing extra but requires planning before construction begins.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Lot Size and Shape</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>How Much Land Do You Need?</h3>
          <p>Lot size requirements depend on your goals:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimum buildable area:</strong> After setbacks, easements, and unbuildable areas (wetlands, steep slopes), is enough usable space remaining?</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy buffer:</strong> How much distance do you want from neighbors?</li>
            <li><strong>Outdoor activities:</strong> Do you want space for gardens, play areas, outbuildings, or recreational activities?</li>
            <li><strong>Future flexibility:</strong> Might you want to add a garage, workshop, or pool later?</li>
            <li><strong>Maintenance capacity:</strong> Can you maintain larger acreage, or would a smaller, manageable lot suit you better?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Lot Shape Considerations</h3>
          <p>Rectangular lots with street frontage are simplest to develop. Irregular shapes, flag lots (deep lots with narrow access), or pie-shaped lots require more creative design but can offer privacy and value.</p>
          <p>Evaluate whether the lot shape accommodates your intended home placement, driveway access, and outdoor space needs. Sometimes an awkward-shaped lot creates unique opportunities; other times it just creates problems.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Bigger isn't always better. The right lot size balances your space needs, budget, and maintenance capacity. We help you think through these trade-offs realistically.</p>

        <h2>The CORELOT Lot Evaluation Process</h2>
        <p>When you're considering a lot—whether you already own it or are thinking about purchasing—we provide comprehensive evaluation:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Site visit:</strong> We walk the property together, noting topography, trees, views, and characteristics</li>
          <li><strong>Research:</strong> We pull zoning information, plat maps, and available surveys</li>
          <li><strong>Testing coordination:</strong> We arrange soil tests, perc tests, or surveys as needed</li>
          <li><strong>Utility confirmation:</strong> We contact utility providers to confirm availability and connection costs</li>
          <li><strong>Preliminary site plan:</strong> We sketch potential home placement, driveway routes, and outdoor spaces</li>
          <li><strong>Cost analysis:</strong> We estimate site-specific development costs</li>
          <li><strong>Honest feedback:</strong> We tell you what works, what concerns us, and what questions remain</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This thorough evaluation protects you from expensive surprises and helps you make informed decisions. If we identify deal-breakers, you know before you're committed. If we see great opportunities, we can design to maximize them.</p>
