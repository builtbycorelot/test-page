        <h1>Building a Custom Home on Your Own Lot</h1>
        <p class="article-meta">What you need to know when you already own the land</p>
      </div>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>You Have the Land—Now What?</h2>
        <p>Maybe you inherited family property. Maybe you found the perfect piece of land with a view you couldn't pass up. Maybe you've owned a lot for years and you're finally ready to build.</p>

        <p>Whatever brought you here, you have something many prospective homebuilders don't: land. That's a huge advantage. But it also comes with unique considerations that buyers in subdivisions don't face.</p>

        <p>At CORELOT, a significant portion of our work is building on client-owned lots. We've worked with everything from pristine cleared lots with all utilities at the street to challenging wooded sites that required careful planning and creative solutions. Let's walk through what you need to know about building on your own land.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Step One: Site Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Before we talk about floor plans or finishes, we need to understand your lot. Not all land is equally buildable, and some sites require significant investment before construction can even begin.</p>

        <h3>What We're Looking For</h3>
        <p>When we evaluate your lot, we're assessing several factors:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Topography and Slopes</h3>
          <p>Is the land relatively flat, gently sloping, or steep? Flat or gently sloping lots are straightforward. Steep lots might require extensive grading, retaining walls, or specialized foundation designs—all of which add cost. But they can also create opportunities for walkout basements or homes with dramatic views.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Soil Conditions</h3>
          <p>Soil type affects foundation design, septic system feasibility, and construction access. Rocky soil means expensive excavation. Highly expansive clay requires engineered foundations. Sandy or well-draining soil is generally ideal. We often recommend a percolation test early to understand what we're working with.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Access</h3>
          <p>How do we get equipment and materials to the building site? Is there existing road frontage? Will we need to build a driveway first? Some rural lots require clearing a path and establishing temporary access before construction can begin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Utilities</h3>
          <p>This is often the most critical question: What utilities are available, and what will it cost to bring them to your building site?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Public water at the street, well required, or community water system?</li>
            <li><strong>Sewer:</strong> Public sewer available, septic system needed, or alternative treatment required?</li>
            <li><strong>Electric:</strong> Power at the street, or does the utility need to extend service?</li>
            <li><strong>Gas:</strong> Natural gas available, or will you use propane?</li>
            <li><strong>Internet/Cable:</strong> Increasingly important—what's available?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>These factors don't necessarily make a lot unbuildable—but they significantly impact budget. A lot that requires a well, septic system, 500-foot electric service extension, and a new driveway could add $40,000-$80,000+ to your project before we even pour a foundation.</p>

        <p>We'll help you understand these costs upfront so there are no surprises.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Step Two: Zoning and Permits</h2>
        <p>Just because you own the land doesn't mean you can build whatever you want on it. Local zoning regulations govern what can be built where.</p>

        <h3>Key Zoning Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Setbacks:</strong> How far from property lines must the house sit?</li>
          <li><strong>Building coverage:</strong> What percentage of the lot can be covered by structures?</li>
          <li><strong>Height restrictions:</strong> Are there limits on building height?</li>
          <li><strong>Accessory structures:</strong> Can you build a detached garage, workshop, or barn?</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental restrictions:</strong> Wetlands, floodplains, or protected areas on the property?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We help navigate this process—researching zoning requirements, coordinating with local building departments, and ensuring your home design complies with all regulations. But it's worth understanding early what restrictions might affect your plans.</p>

        <h3>The Permitting Process</h3>
        <p>Building permits vary by jurisdiction, but generally require:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Approved building plans and engineering</li>
          <li>Site plan showing property boundaries, setbacks, and proposed building location</li>
          <li>Septic permit (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Well permit (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Erosion and sediment control plan</li>
          <li>Various inspections throughout construction</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We handle permit submissions and coordinate inspections. You don't need to become an expert in building codes—that's our job. But understanding that permitting takes time (often 4-8 weeks) helps with timeline expectations.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Step Three: Designing for Your Specific Site</h2>
        <p>Here's where building on your own lot gets exciting: we can design your home specifically for your property.</p>

        <p>In a subdivision, homes are often oriented the same way regardless of sun exposure, views, or wind patterns. On your own lot, we have flexibility.</p>

        <h3>Site-Specific Design Considerations</h3>
        <p><strong>Orientation:</strong> Where does the sun rise and set? Can we position living spaces to capture natural light? Should we orient the house to take advantage of prevailing breezes for natural cooling?</p>

        <p><strong>Views:</strong> What do you want to see from your windows? We can position rooms to capture the best views while screening less desirable sightlines.</p>

        <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> Where are neighboring properties? Can we use design and landscaping to create privacy?</p>

        <p><strong>Topography:</strong> Can we use elevation changes to our advantage—perhaps a walkout basement or a home that steps down a hillside?</p>

        <p><strong>Existing features:</strong> Are there mature trees worth saving? Natural features to preserve? We'll design around assets rather than bulldozing everything.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>The Lot Shapes the Design</h3>
          <p>A long narrow lot might suggest a different floor plan than a wide, shallow lot. A corner lot has different access considerations than a lot mid-block. Your specific property informs design decisions.</p>
          <p>This is why we always visit the site before finalizing plans—what looks simple on paper might have opportunities or constraints that only become apparent in person.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Step Four: Understanding Site Work Costs</h2>
        <p>Site work is often the biggest variable when building on your own lot. Here's what typically falls into this category:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clearing and grading:</strong> Removing trees, brush, and debris; shaping the site for construction</li>
          <li><strong>Excavation:</strong> Digging for foundation and utilities</li>
          <li><strong>Driveway:</strong> Materials, length, and grading all affect cost</li>
          <li><strong>Well and septic:</strong> If needed, these are significant expenses</li>
          <li><strong>Utility connections:</strong> Bringing power, water, and gas to the house</li>
          <li><strong>Erosion control:</strong> Required during construction to prevent runoff</li>
          <li><strong>Final grading and landscaping:</strong> Establishing lawns and drainage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Site work on a simple, cleared lot with utilities available might be $15,000-$25,000. A challenging rural site might be $60,000-$100,000 or more. These aren't builder markups—they're actual costs for equipment, materials, and specialized contractors.</p>

        <p>We provide detailed site work estimates as part of our overall project pricing, so you know what to expect.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Step Five: Budgeting the Complete Project</h2>
        <p>When you build on your own lot, your budget needs to account for more than just the house:</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Total Project Budget Components</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Land cost:</strong> Already paid, but it factors into total investment</li>
            <li><strong>Site work:</strong> Everything needed to prepare the lot for construction</li>
            <li><strong>House construction:</strong> The actual building</li>
            <li><strong>Permits and fees:</strong> Building permits, impact fees, utility connection charges</li>
            <li><strong>Professional services:</strong> Engineering, surveying, septic design</li>
            <li><strong>Financing costs:</strong> Construction loan fees and interest</li>
            <li><strong>Contingency:</strong> 10-15% buffer for unexpected issues</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Many people focus only on house construction cost, then struggle when site work comes in higher than expected. We help you build a realistic total budget from day one.</p>

        <h2>Common Challenges and How We Address Them</h2>
        <p>Building on your own lot isn't always straightforward. Here are challenges we see frequently and how we handle them:</p>

        <h3>Challenge: Unrealistic Expectations</h3>
        <p><strong>The situation:</strong> "I paid $50,000 for this lot, so I should be able to build for less than if I'd bought a $100,000 lot in a subdivision, right?"</p>

        <p><strong>The reality:</strong> Maybe, maybe not. That subdivision lot has utilities stubbed, roads paved, and necessary approvals complete. Your raw land might require significant investment to reach the same buildable state.</p>

        <p><strong>How we help:</strong> We evaluate your lot early and provide honest cost estimates so you can make informed decisions.</p>

        <h3>Challenge: Lot Limitations</h3>
        <p><strong>The situation:</strong> Steep slopes, poor drainage, difficult access, or environmental restrictions limit building options.</p>

        <p><strong>How we help:</strong> We design creative solutions that work with your lot's constraints—or we're honest if a site is truly problematic. Sometimes the best advice is "this lot isn't right for what you want to build."</p>

        <h3>Challenge: Utility Costs</h3>
        <p><strong>The situation:</strong> Extending utilities to a remote building site becomes prohibitively expensive.</p>

        <p><strong>How we help:</strong> We explore alternatives—can the building site be moved closer to utilities? Are there cost-sharing opportunities with neighbors? What's the most economical combination of well/septic/solar/propane?</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Why Build on Your Own Lot?</h2>
        <p>Despite the challenges, building on your own lot offers unique advantages:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Location control:</strong> You're not limited to where builders are developing</li>
          <li><strong>Property character:</strong> Mature trees, views, acreage, privacy—features hard to find in subdivisions</li>
          <li><strong>Design freedom:</strong> Fewer HOA restrictions; more flexibility in home design</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term value:</strong> Desirable locations often appreciate well</li>
          <li><strong>Personal meaning:</strong> Family land or a spot you fell in love with carries emotional value</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For many clients, these advantages far outweigh the additional complexity. They want their home on their land, and we're here to make that happen.</p>
