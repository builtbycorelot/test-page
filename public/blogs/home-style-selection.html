        <h2>Style Is More Than Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>When we talk about home styles with clients, the conversation often starts with Pinterest boards and Instagram saves. Someone shows us a modern farmhouse they love, or a craftsman bungalow that caught their eye. That's a great starting point, but choosing a home style involves more than just picking what looks pretty in photos.</p>

        <p>The right architectural style for your home depends on three interconnected factors: your lot characteristics, your budget realities, and how you actually want to live. A style that works beautifully on a wooded hillside lot might look out of place on a flat suburban street. A design you love might require materials or details that push beyond your budget. And most importantly, a home that photographs well might not function well for your daily life.</p>

        <p>Let's break down the most popular styles we build, what makes each one distinctive, and how to choose the right direction for your project.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Popular Home Styles We Build</h2>

        <h3>Modern Farmhouse</h3>
        <p>This is probably the most requested style right now, and for good reason. Modern farmhouse blends traditional farmhouse proportions—simple rooflines, covered porches, board-and-batten siding—with contemporary details like large windows, open floor plans, and clean lines.</p>

        <p><strong>Signature features:</strong> Board-and-batten or vertical siding, metal roofing (often standing seam), large windows with black frames, covered front porches, simple gable roofs, neutral color palettes (whites, grays, blacks).</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You have a rural or semi-rural lot, you want a relaxed but polished aesthetic, you appreciate traditional charm without feeling dated, you value open, light-filled interiors.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget considerations:</strong> Metal roofing costs more than asphalt shingles. Large windows are an investment. Board-and-batten requires more labor than standard lap siding. However, the simple rooflines keep framing costs reasonable.</p>

        <h3>Craftsman</h3>
        <p>Craftsman style emerged in the early 1900s as a reaction against mass production, emphasizing handcrafted details and natural materials. It's enduringly popular because it feels warm, grounded, and timeless.</p>

        <p><strong>Signature features:</strong> Low-pitched roofs with wide eaves, exposed rafter tails, tapered columns on front porches, mixed materials (stone, wood, siding), built-in cabinetry, decorative brackets and beams, multiple roof planes.</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You have a treed lot or established neighborhood, you appreciate traditional details and character, you want defined rooms rather than completely open plans, you're drawn to natural wood and stone.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget considerations:</strong> Multiple roof planes and custom details add cost. Stone accents are an investment. Built-ins require extra cabinetry budget. But craftsman homes have strong resale appeal that can justify the investment.</p>

        <h3>Traditional/Colonial</h3>
        <p>Traditional homes draw from colonial American architecture—symmetrical facades, classic proportions, familiar details. They're the opposite of trendy, which is exactly why some people love them.</p>

        <p><strong>Signature features:</strong> Symmetrical front elevation, center-hall floor plan, multi-pane windows, brick or traditional lap siding, shutters, simple gable or hip roofs, formal dining and living spaces.</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You're in a neighborhood with similar homes, you want timeless appeal that won't feel dated, you appreciate formal spaces and traditional layouts, you're planning long-term ownership.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget considerations:</strong> Traditional styles can be cost-effective because of simple, efficient framing. Brick veneer adds cost but provides durability and classic appeal. Standard windows and roofing are straightforward.</p>

        <h3>Ranch/Rambler</h3>
        <p>Single-story living never goes out of style. Modern ranch homes update mid-century proportions with contemporary materials and open layouts while maintaining the accessibility and flow that makes ranches so practical.</p>

        <p><strong>Signature features:</strong> Single-story layout, long horizontal lines, attached garage, open floor plans, connections to outdoor spaces, emphasis on easy living, minimal stairs.</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You want all living spaces on one level, you have a wide lot (ranches need more width than depth), you value accessibility and aging-in-place, you want strong indoor-outdoor flow.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget considerations:</strong> More roof and foundation per square foot than two-story homes (since all space is on one level). However, you save on stairs, second-floor framing, and HVAC complexity. Great value for accessible living.</p>

        <h3>Contemporary</h3>
        <p>Contemporary homes embrace current design trends—clean lines, minimalist details, innovative materials, strong connections to landscape. This style is for people who want their home to feel distinctly of this moment.</p>

        <p><strong>Signature features:</strong> Flat or low-slope roofs, large expanses of glass, asymmetrical compositions, mixed materials (metal, wood, concrete, glass), open plans, minimal trim and ornamentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Works well when:</strong> You have a unique lot with views or interesting topography, you appreciate modern architecture and design, you want a home that makes a statement, you're comfortable with something less traditional.</p>

        <p><strong>Budget considerations:</strong> Custom windows and doors can be expensive. Flat roofs require different (often costlier) roofing systems. Minimalist details require precision execution. That said, simple forms can be efficient to build.</p>

        <h2>How Your Lot Influences Style Choice</h2>
        <p>Your lot isn't a blank canvas—it has characteristics that make certain styles more or less appropriate.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Wooded or Hillside Lots</h3>
          <p>Craftsman and modern farmhouse styles work beautifully here. Their natural materials and multiple roof planes help homes settle into wooded settings. Ranch homes can be challenging on steep slopes but work well on gentle hillsides.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Flat Suburban Lots</h3>
          <p>Traditional, colonial, and modern farmhouse styles are neighborhood-friendly choices. Contemporary homes can work but might stand out significantly depending on surrounding homes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Rural or Large Acreage</h3>
          <p>You have the most flexibility. Modern farmhouse, craftsman, ranch, and contemporary styles all work. Consider sight lines from roads and how the home sits in open landscape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h3>Narrow or Compact Lots</h3>
          <p>Two-story designs (farmhouse, traditional, craftsman) make better use of limited width. Ranch homes need wider lots to work well. Pay attention to window placement for privacy.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We'll always walk your lot with you before finalizing style direction. Sometimes what you think you want shifts once you see how different approaches would work with your specific site.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Matching Style to How You Live</h2>
        <p>Beyond aesthetics and site fit, think about how different styles align with your lifestyle preferences.</p>

        <p><strong>If you love to entertain:</strong> Modern farmhouse and contemporary styles typically feature the most open, flowing layouts. Great rooms that combine kitchen, dining, and living work well for gatherings.</p>

        <p><strong>If you value privacy and defined spaces:</strong> Craftsman and traditional homes often have more distinct rooms. Formal dining rooms, separate living spaces, and defined zones.</p>

        <p><strong>If you work from home:</strong> Any style can accommodate home offices, but craftsman homes often feature built-in spaces that create natural work zones. Ranch layouts provide separation between work and living areas without climbing stairs.</p>

        <p><strong>If you have mobility considerations:</strong> Ranch style is the obvious choice for single-level living, but you can also design two-story homes with main-floor master suites in any style.</p>

        <p><strong>If you prioritize natural light:</strong> Modern farmhouse and contemporary styles typically maximize windows and light. Traditional and craftsman can too, but it requires intentional design since these styles sometimes emphasize coziness over brightness.</p>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Can You Mix Styles?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely. Some of our best homes blend elements from multiple styles. A house might have craftsman proportions with modern farmhouse materials. Or traditional symmetry with contemporary details.</p>

        <p>The key is having a clear vision for what you're trying to achieve. "I want a farmhouse with craftsman front porch details" works. "I want a little bit of everything" usually doesn't.</p>

        <p>This is where working with builders who also design becomes valuable. We can show you how different combinations look and help you create something cohesive rather than confused.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="article-section">
        <h2>Don't Forget Resale (But Don't Obsess Over It)</h2>
        <p>We're always honest with clients about resale implications. If you're building an ultra-contemporary home in a neighborhood of traditional colonials, that will affect your buyer pool someday. It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it—just go in with eyes open.</p>

        <p>Generally, modern farmhouse, craftsman, and traditional styles have the broadest appeal. Contemporary and highly customized styles appeal to smaller (but often passionate) buyer pools.</p>

        <p>Our advice: Build what you love and will enjoy living in. If you plan to stay 10+ years, resale concerns matter less than your daily happiness. If you're building speculatively or might move sooner, lean toward broader appeal.</p>

        <h2>How We Help You Choose</h2>
        <p>At CORELOT, we don't push you toward any particular style. Our design process starts with understanding you—your preferences, your lot, your budget, your lifestyle. Then we'll show you options and explain the implications of each direction.</p>

        <p>We'll create 3D renderings so you can see how different styles would look on your specific lot. We'll break down cost differences between approaches. We'll show you photos of similar homes we've built.</p>

        <p>Most importantly, we'll be honest. If we think a style you're considering won't work well for your site or budget, we'll tell you why and suggest alternatives. Our goal isn't to talk you into anything—it's to help you make an informed decision you'll love long-term.</p>
