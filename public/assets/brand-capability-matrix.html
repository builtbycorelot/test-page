      <h1>Brand & Capability Matrix</h1>
      <p class="article-meta" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #444;">A strategic framework showing how our integrated family of companies delivers comprehensive construction, development, and technology services under unified brand standards.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- What It Is -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>What Is the Brand & Capability Matrix?</h2>
      <p>The Brand & Capability Matrix is a one-page visual document that presents our complete service ecosystem at a glance. It maps our six distinct brands—CORELOT Homes, CORELOT Construction, Consolidated Contracting, Eveready Builders Group, SheetPros, and OnTime Solutions—and clearly articulates how each contributes to our integrated approach to residential and commercial construction.</p>

      <p>This strategic asset serves as both an internal alignment tool and an external marketing piece. We use it to help clients, partners, and stakeholders understand our unique position as a vertically integrated construction and technology company. Unlike competitors who focus on a single service area, we offer end-to-end solutions from land acquisition and design through construction, digital integration, and project delivery.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box mt-lg">
        <h3>Key Components</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Unified Header:</strong> Emphasizes our integrated approach with the tagline "Built for the way you live — Delivered on-site & on-time"</li>
          <li><strong>Brand Cards:</strong> Each company is presented with consistent visual treatment, icons, and capability descriptions</li>
          <li><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Top section focuses on construction and development; bottom section highlights digital integration and logistics</li>
          <li><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Central divider reinforces "One family of companies. Every capability under one roof."</li>
          <li><strong>Professional Design:</strong> Clean, print-ready format (8.5" x 11") suitable for presentations, proposals, and leave-behinds</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- When to Use It -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>When to Use the Brand & Capability Matrix</h2>
      <p>The matrix is most effective in situations where stakeholders need to understand our full scope of services and how our integrated model creates value. Here are the ideal scenarios for deployment.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Initial Client Consultations</h3>
        <p>Use the matrix early in conversations with prospective clients who may not fully understand CORELOT's integrated approach. It helps position us as a comprehensive partner rather than a single-service provider. This is especially valuable when clients initially contact us for one service (like a home plan) but could benefit from our other capabilities (land selection, permitting support, construction management).</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Talking Point:</strong> "We're unique in this market because we can support your project from initial concept through final construction and beyond, with integrated digital tools that keep everything on schedule."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Strategic Partnership Discussions</h3>
        <p>When meeting with realtors, land developers, municipal planners, or other potential partners, the matrix quickly establishes credibility and demonstrates scale. Partners need to understand that we're not just a small builder—we're a family of companies with complementary strengths that create operational efficiencies and project delivery advantages.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Use Case:</strong> Presenting to a developer who's considering partnership options for a new subdivision. The matrix shows we can handle everything from site planning (OnTime Solutions) through construction (CORELOT Construction) to home sales (CORELOT Homes).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>RFPs and Competitive Bids</h3>
        <p>Include the matrix in formal proposal submissions to differentiate CORELOT from competitors. Many RFPs ask specifically about company capabilities, resources, and integrated services. The matrix provides a professional, visual answer that's more impactful than a text-only capabilities statement.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Strategic Advantage:</strong> Most competitors can only claim one or two capability areas. Our matrix demonstrates comprehensive coverage that reduces client coordination burden and project risk.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Educational & Networking Events</h3>
        <p>At industry conferences, community events, or networking sessions, the matrix serves as an effective conversation starter and takeaway. It's substantial enough to demonstrate professionalism while concise enough that busy contacts will actually review it later.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Internal Team Alignment</h3>
        <p>Use the matrix during team meetings, cross-company collaborations, and onboarding sessions. It helps everyone understand how their work fits into the larger ecosystem and identifies opportunities for internal referrals between divisions.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Best Practices -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Best Practices & Usage Tips</h2>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Do's</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Print on high-quality paper (minimum 28lb, preferably 32lb bright white)</li>
            <li>Pair with specific service materials relevant to the client's immediate needs</li>
            <li>Use as a conversation guide—walk through each brand and ask which services align with client goals</li>
            <li>Keep digital copies easily accessible on tablets or laptops for impromptu presentations</li>
            <li>Update regularly if brand descriptions or service offerings change</li>
            <li>Reference the matrix when making cross-company referrals or identifying upsell opportunities</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Don'ts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't assume everyone needs all services—use it to identify relevant capabilities, not overwhelm</li>
            <li>Don't distribute in isolation—always pair with context (email explanation, verbal presentation, etc.)</li>
            <li>Don't print on low-quality paper or from low-resolution files—it undermines our professional image</li>
            <li>Don't alter the design or remove brand sections without marketing team approval</li>
            <li>Don't use outdated versions—check with marketing to ensure you have the current file</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="highlight-box mt-lg">
        <h3>Effective Presentation Sequence</h3>
        <p>When presenting the matrix in person, we recommend this flow:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
          <li><strong>Start with Context:</strong> "Let me show you how CORELOT is structured differently than most builders..."</li>
          <li><strong>Explain the Integration:</strong> Point out the mission statement—"One family of companies. Every capability under one roof."</li>
          <li><strong>Walk Through Relevance:</strong> Focus on the 2-3 brands most relevant to the client's current needs</li>
          <li><strong>Highlight Advantages:</strong> Emphasize streamlined communication, accountability, and timeline benefits</li>
          <li><strong>Invite Questions:</strong> "Which of these capabilities are most interesting for your project?"</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Messaging Framework -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Messaging Framework & Talk Track</h2>
      <p>The matrix is most effective when paired with confident, clear verbal messaging. Here's our recommended talk track for different audiences.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>For Residential Homebuyers</h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-bottom: 1rem;">"Most builders can only help you once you have land and have selected a plan. We're different. Through our family of companies, we can help you find the right lot, navigate permitting and site work, customize your home plan, manage construction, and even provide digital tools to track progress every step of the way. Everything stays under one roof, which means better communication and accountability for you."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>For Commercial or Institutional Clients</h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-bottom: 1rem;">"CORELOT brings together construction management, digital integration, and field logistics expertise. Whether you need traditional building services through CORELOT Construction and Eveready Builders Group, or specialized digital capabilities through SheetPros and OnTime Solutions, we coordinate everything internally. That integration reduces your coordination burden and keeps projects on schedule."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>For Strategic Partners (Developers, Realtors, Municipalities)</h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-bottom: 1rem;">"We've intentionally built complementary capabilities across six brands so we can support projects from concept through completion. For a subdivision development, that might mean OnTime Solutions handles geospatial planning, CORELOT Homes provides the building plans and sales support, CORELOT Construction delivers the builds, and SheetPros integrates all the project management systems. One point of contact, one accountability structure, seamless execution."</p>
