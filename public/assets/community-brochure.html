      <h1>Community Brochure Templates</h1>
      <p class="article-meta" style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #444;">Comprehensive print templates for marketing entire communities, subdivisions, and multi-home developments with professional layouts and on-brand design.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- What It Is -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>What Are Community Brochures?</h2>
      <p>Community brochures are multi-page print marketing pieces designed to showcase entire neighborhoods, subdivisions, or planned developments. Unlike single-home flyers that focus on one property, these brochures tell the complete story of a community—from location advantages and amenities to available home styles, pricing, and the lifestyle residents can expect.</p>

      <p>We've developed several template formats to support different community types and marketing objectives. Whether you're launching a new subdivision with multiple available lots, marketing a master-planned community with extensive amenities, or promoting an established neighborhood with select new construction opportunities, we have templates designed for your needs.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box mt-lg">
        <h3>What Makes an Effective Community Brochure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visual Storytelling:</strong> High-quality photography showing completed homes, amenities, outdoor spaces, and community lifestyle</li>
          <li><strong>Clear Information Hierarchy:</strong> Organized sections that guide readers from big-picture community benefits to specific home details</li>
          <li><strong>Location Context:</strong> Maps, proximity to schools/shopping/employment, and regional context that helps buyers envision daily life</li>
          <li><strong>Available Inventory:</strong> Clear presentation of available lots, home plans, pricing ranges, and purchase options</li>
          <li><strong>Professional Credibility:</strong> Consistent CORELOT branding, proper EHO compliance, and polished design that builds trust</li>
          <li><strong>Strong Calls-to-Action:</strong> Multiple pathways for interested buyers to take next steps (schedule tour, request information, view online)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Template Formats -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Available Template Formats</h2>
      <p>We offer three primary community brochure formats, each optimized for different marketing scenarios and budget considerations.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Tri-Fold Brochure (8.5" x 11" Folded)</h3>
        <p>Our most versatile format, the tri-fold brochure provides six panels of content (three inside, three outside) in a compact, cost-effective package. This format works beautifully for smaller communities or when you need quantity for broad distribution.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Panel Layout:</strong></p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Front Cover:</strong> Community name, hero image, tagline</li>
          <li><strong>Inside Left:</strong> Community overview, location benefits, amenities</li>
          <li><strong>Inside Center:</strong> Available home plans with photos and key features</li>
          <li><strong>Inside Right:</strong> Pricing, financing options, timeline, next steps</li>
          <li><strong>Back Left:</strong> Community map or site plan showing lots and amenities</li>
          <li><strong>Back Right:</strong> Contact information, CORELOT branding, EHO compliance</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Best for:</strong> Communities with 3-6 available home plans, direct mail campaigns, realtor outreach, community events, rack displays at local businesses.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>6-Panel Accordion Fold (11" x 17" Folded)</h3>
        <p>This larger format unfolds to reveal a dramatic presentation with more space for photography, detailed floor plans, and extensive amenity descriptions. The accordion fold creates natural content sections while allowing for an impressive full-spread reveal.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Best for:</strong> Premium communities, master-planned developments with significant amenities, luxury or custom home offerings, presentations to high-value prospects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Multi-Page Booklet (8-12 Pages)</h3>
        <p>For large-scale developments or communities with diverse offerings, our multi-page booklet format provides maximum flexibility. This saddle-stitched or perfect-bound format allows for comprehensive storytelling with dedicated pages for each home plan, detailed amenity descriptions, testimonials, and extensive photography.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Best for:</strong> Master-planned communities, developments with 8+ home plans, communities requiring extensive explanation (sustainable features, smart home technology, architectural standards), high-value sales presentations.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- How to Use Community Brochures -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>How to Use Community Brochures Effectively</h2>
      <p>Community brochures serve multiple purposes throughout the sales cycle. Strategic deployment ensures you're reaching the right audiences with the right materials at the right time.</p>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Direct Mail Campaigns</h3>
          <p>Target specific ZIP codes, demographics, or rental communities with direct mail pieces. The tri-fold format is ideal for large-volume mailings while staying within postal size and weight parameters for standard rates.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Include a specific call-to-action with a deadline—"Schedule your tour by March 31st and receive a $500 design center credit."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Realtor Partnership Programs</h3>
          <p>Equip partner realtors with professional community brochures they can share with qualified buyers. Provide quantity so they can confidently distribute without worrying about running out.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666;"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Consider adding a "Your Realtor" panel where partner agents can stamp or sticker their contact information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>On-Site Model Homes</h3>
          <p>Display brochures prominently in model homes, sales offices, and welcome centers. Buyers should be able to easily grab a brochure to take home and share with family members or decision partners.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Community Events & Open Houses</h3>
          <p>Hand out brochures at grand openings, model home unveilings, community festivals, or special events. The brochure serves as a tangible reminder of the community after the event concludes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Local Business Partnerships</h3>
          <p>Place brochures in complementary businesses—mortgage brokers, title companies, moving companies, furniture stores, home improvement centers. These partnerships put your materials in front of people already in "home mode."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Digital PDF Distribution</h3>
          <p>While designed for print, community brochures also work as PDF downloads on your website or email attachments for remote prospects. Ensure PDFs are optimized for screen viewing with linked CTAs.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- When to Use Community Brochures -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>When to Create a Community Brochure</h2>
      <p>Timing matters with community brochures. Create them at strategic moments in your development lifecycle to maximize impact and sales momentum.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Pre-Launch Marketing (60-90 Days Before Sales Open)</h3>
        <p>Build anticipation with "Coming Soon" brochures that highlight location, planned amenities, and home plan previews. Even without final pricing or completed construction, you can generate interest and build prospect lists.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Include:</strong> Expected opening date, pre-registration opportunities, virtual tours or renderings, phase 1 details.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Grand Opening Launch</h3>
        <p>Create your most comprehensive brochure for the official community launch. This version should include completed photography, final pricing, all available home plans, and financing details. Print in volume—you'll distribute heavily during the critical launch period.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>New Phase Releases</h3>
        <p>When opening new sections of a phased community, update your brochure to reflect new lots, additional home plans, or enhanced amenities. This keeps marketing materials current and gives you a reason to re-engage previous prospects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Seasonal Marketing Pushes</h3>
        <p>Refresh brochures for spring and fall selling seasons, highlighting seasonal benefits (summer pool access, winter holiday move-in timing). Update photography to show the community in current season.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Price Adjustments or Special Promotions</h3>
        <p>When running limited-time incentives, price reductions, or special financing offers, create updated brochures that prominently feature these opportunities with clear deadlines.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Content Guidelines -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Content & Messaging Guidelines</h2>
      <p>What you say in your community brochure is just as important as how it looks. Follow these content principles to create compelling, effective brochures.</p>

      <div class="grid-2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Lead with Lifestyle, Not Features</h3>
          <p>Start with the emotional benefits of living in this community. Paint a picture of daily life—morning coffee on the porch, evening walks through tree-lined streets, kids playing in the community park. Then support that vision with specific features and amenities.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #666;">"Imagine a neighborhood where children safely bike to the community pool while you tend your garden, knowing great schools and shopping are just minutes away."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Be Specific About Location Benefits</h3>
          <p>Don't just say "convenient location." Provide exact details: "7 minutes to Stafford High School," "12 minutes to Quantico," "Walking distance to shopping at Courthouse Village."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Show the Numbers That Matter</h3>
          <p>Be transparent about pricing ranges, typical monthly payments (with clear disclaimers), square footage, lot sizes, and timeline from contract to move-in. Buyers appreciate straightforward information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Use Resident Voices When Possible</h3>
          <p>For established communities, brief testimonials from actual residents add authenticity and credibility. A quote from a satisfied homeowner carries more weight than any marketing claim.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Address Common Questions Pre-emptively</h3>
          <p>Include FAQs or informational callouts about HOA fees, included features vs. options, customization policies, and typical purchase timeline. Reducing uncertainty helps prospects move forward with confidence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Strong, Clear Calls-to-Action</h3>
          <p>Every brochure should clearly tell readers what to do next: "Schedule Your Private Tour," "Visit Our Model Homes," "Download Floor Plans," "Speak with a Community Specialist." Make the next step obvious and easy.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Photography & Visual Guidelines -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Photography & Visual Best Practices</h2>
      <p>Professional photography transforms a good brochure into a great one. Invest in quality visuals that accurately represent the community experience.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Essential Photography Shots</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Community Entrance:</strong> Professional shot of signage, landscaping, entry features that create first impressions</li>
          <li><strong>Completed Homes:</strong> Exterior shots of each available plan style, photographed in favorable light with landscaping</li>
          <li><strong>Interior Vignettes:</strong> Key rooms (kitchen, great room, primary suite) staged to show lifestyle and quality</li>
          <li><strong>Amenities in Use:</strong> Pool with families, playground with children, walking trails with residents (ensure photo releases)</li>
          <li><strong>Neighborhood Context:</strong> Street scenes showing home variety, green spaces, community character</li>
          <li><strong>Location Shots:</strong> Nearby schools, shopping centers, parks, or landmarks that demonstrate convenience</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Photography Standards:</strong> All images should be high-resolution (300 DPI for print), professionally shot and edited, and accurately represent current conditions. Avoid overly saturated or heavily filtered images that create unrealistic expectations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mt-lg">
        <h3>Site Maps & Plat Illustrations</h3>
        <p>Include a clear, easy-to-read site map showing lot locations, phases, amenity placement, entry points, and orientation. Color-code lots by status (available, under contract, sold) if applicable. Ensure north arrows and scale indicators are present for context.</p>
      </div>
