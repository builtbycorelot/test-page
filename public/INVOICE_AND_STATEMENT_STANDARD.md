CORELOT
Invoice & Statement Standards Policy
Version 1.0 (Public)

## Part I — Invoice Standard & Policy

**Purpose.** Invoices are treated as financial, contractual, and auditable records. This policy reflects CORELOT’s historical electronic invoice standard while modernizing it for current systems.

**Submission channel.** Electronic-only submission; paper invoices are not accepted. Submit all invoices as PDF attachments to [ap@corelot.net](mailto:ap@corelot.net).

**Format.** PDF only, legible, and correctly oriented. File names should clearly identify the vendor and invoice number.

**Scope.** One job per invoice; multi-job invoices are not accepted.

**Required invoice data elements.** Each invoice must include:

- Unique invoice number
- Invoice date
- CORELOT PO Number **or** CORELOT Job Name
- CORELOT Cost Code (when provided)
- Payment terms
- Total amount due

**Line-item clarity.** Provide clear, itemized descriptions and quantities. Vague lump sums are not allowed unless CORELOT pre-approves them in writing.

**Enforcement.** Non-compliant invoices may be rejected or experience payment delays until corrected.

## Part II — Statement Standard

Statements summarize activity; they do not replace invoices. Each statement must include:

- Vendor identification
- Statement date
- Beginning balance
- Invoices issued (with invoice numbers)
- Payments received
- Credits/adjustments
- Ending balance

**Invoice dependency.** Every statement amount must tie to a compliant invoice. Statements without compliant invoices are not payable. Preferred format: PDF.

## Part III — Referenced Standards & Derivation

This policy aligns with and derives from:

- U.S. GAAP
- AICPA audit documentation expectations
- IRS record-keeping requirements
- UBL (Universal Business Language) invoice concepts
- ISO 20022 financial messaging principles
- PEPPOL e-invoicing requirements
- Structured data and schema-based system design principles
- XBRL concepts for financial reference integrity

An invoice is treated as a structured data object first, and a document second.

> **If an invoice cannot be understood by a human and processed by a system without explanation, it is not complete.**
