      <h2>Builder roots</h2>
      <p>Our team has delivered hundreds of WL Martin-inspired homes across the Commonwealth. We keep a deep bench of local trade partners so craftsmanship stays consistent from subdivision lots to acreage builds.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Process-first</h2>
      <p>We publish our content as code, validate data before deploy, and pre-render every page. That discipline mirrors our field process: transparent schedules, documented scopes, and proactive site walks.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>Where we build</h2>
      <p>From Stafford to Culpeper and into the DC metro, we meet you on your homesite, confirm feasibility, and align financing with the plan you love.</p>
