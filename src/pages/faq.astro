    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do I need to own land before contacting you?</h3>
      <p>No. Many clients contact us while they're still shopping for land. We're happy to review potential lots before you purchase and provide feedback on feasibility, estimated site costs, and any red flags. Knowing these details upfront can save you from buying a lot that's too expensive to build on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What's the first step if I'm interested in working with CORELOT?</h3>
      <p>Schedule a complimentary consultation call. We'll discuss your land (or land you're considering), budget, timeline, and vision. This is a no-pressure conversation to determine if on-your-lot construction is right for you and if we're a good fit. <a href="/contact">Contact us here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How much does the initial consultation cost?</h3>
      <p>Nothing. The initial consultation is free. If we decide to move forward, the next step is a design retainer (typically $5,000–$10,000) that covers site evaluation, plan selection, and budgeting. This retainer is credited toward construction if we proceed to contract.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How do I know if my project is a good fit for CORELOT?</h3>
      <p>We specialize in on-your-lot construction in Northern and Central Virginia. Ideal projects involve clients who value transparency, understand that site conditions affect budget, and are willing to start with a design retainer to ensure realistic expectations before breaking ground.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="land-site" class="faq-category">
    <h2>Land & Site Requirements</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What if my lot doesn't have public water or sewer?</h3>
      <p>That's common in our service area. We build on lots with well and septic systems regularly. During the design retainer phase, we'll order a perc test to confirm the lot can support a septic system and estimate well drilling costs based on local geology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How steep can my lot be?</h3>
      <p>We've built on challenging topography, but steeper lots require more extensive grading and foundation work, which increases costs. During site evaluation, we'll assess slope and drainage to determine if the lot is feasible and what site work will be required.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What if there's rock on my property?</h3>
      <p>Rock excavation is one of the most common unforeseen costs in on-your-lot construction. If we suspect rock based on topography or soil reports, we may recommend test pits before finalizing the budget. Blasting or rock removal can add significant cost, so we address this upfront.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do you handle site work (clearing, grading, septic, well)?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We coordinate all site work including tree clearing, grading, septic installation, well drilling (if needed), utility trenching, and stormwater management. You won't need to hire separate contractors for these tasks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What zoning or setback issues should I be aware of?</h3>
      <p>Every county has different setback requirements (how far the house must be from property lines), lot coverage limits, and zoning restrictions. We review these during the design retainer phase to ensure your chosen plan can legally fit on the lot with room for septic, well, and driveways.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="process-timeline" class="faq-category">
    <h2>Process & Timeline</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How long does it take from start to finish?</h3>
      <p>Typically 12–18 months from design retainer to final walkthrough, depending on permitting timelines and site complexity. This includes design retainer (4–8 weeks), permitting (6–12 weeks), site prep (2–4 weeks), and construction (7–10 months).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What's a design retainer and why do you require it?</h3>
      <p>The design retainer ($5,000–$10,000) covers site evaluation, soil testing, plan selection, and detailed budgeting before we commit to a construction contract. This protects both you and us from moving forward with a project that's not feasible. If the numbers don't work, you walk away having spent only the retainer. If they do, the retainer is credited to construction costs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can the timeline be shorter?</h3>
      <p>Rarely. Permitting timelines are controlled by local jurisdictions and can't be rushed. Construction phases depend on inspections, material lead times, and weather. We provide realistic timelines and communicate any delays promptly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What permits are required and who handles them?</h3>
      <p>We handle all permit applications including building permits, septic permits, well permits (if applicable), and erosion control permits. You'll sign applications as the property owner, but we manage the process and coordinate inspections.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What happens if we encounter unexpected issues during construction?</h3>
      <p>We communicate immediately. Whether it's rock excavation, unforeseen drainage issues, or material delays, you'll know what's happening and what your options are. Most surprises can be mitigated with the thorough site evaluation we conduct during the design retainer phase.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="financing-budget" class="faq-category">
    <h2>Financing & Budget</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What's the typical cost per square foot?</h3>
      <p>There's no one-size-fits-all answer because site work varies dramatically. A flat lot with public utilities might cost $200–$250/sqft for the house itself, while a challenging lot requiring extensive grading, septic, and well could push total project costs to $300+/sqft. This is why we start with a design retainer to provide an accurate, site-specific budget.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What's included in the construction contract price?</h3>
      <p>Everything needed to deliver a complete, move-in-ready home: site work, foundation, framing, roofing, mechanicals (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), insulation, drywall, flooring, cabinetry, countertops, trim, paint, appliances, and fixtures. We provide a detailed line-item budget during the design retainer so there are no surprises.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do you work with construction-to-permanent loans?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Most of our clients use construction-to-permanent (construction-perm) loans, which convert to a traditional mortgage after construction. We work with several lender partners experienced in on-your-lot financing. <a href="/financing">See our financing guide</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What deposit is required?</h3>
      <p>Typically 10% of the contract price is due at contract signing. This covers initial material orders and mobilization costs. The remaining balance is paid through lender draws as construction progresses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I be my own general contractor to save money?</h3>
      <p>We don't offer plans-only or owner-builder arrangements. On-your-lot construction involves coordinating dozens of trades, managing inspections, navigating permitting, and solving site-specific challenges. Our fee covers this expertise and ensures the project stays on schedule and on budget.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What if my budget is tight?</h3>
      <p>We're honest about what's achievable within your budget. If your budget is too tight for the lot and plan you're considering, we'll tell you upfront during the design retainer phase. You can then adjust the plan, choose a less challenging lot, or wait until your budget increases. We won't move forward unless we're confident we can deliver within your means.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="design-plans" class="faq-category">
    <h2>Design & Plans</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I customize one of your plans?</h3>
      <p>Yes, within reason. Minor adjustments like moving doors, changing window sizes, or reconfiguring closets are straightforward. Major structural changes (moving load-bearing walls, adding square footage) require re-engineering and increase costs. We discuss customization options during the design retainer phase.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I bring my own plans from an architect?</h3>
      <p>Possibly. We need to review the plans to ensure they're buildable, compliant with local codes, and appropriate for your site conditions. Custom architectural plans often require adjustments for engineering, cost, or site constraints.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What if I don't know which plan I want yet?</h3>
      <p>That's fine. During the design retainer phase, we'll discuss your lifestyle needs, budget, and lot constraints to help you narrow down options. We'll walk you through floor plans and recommend what works best for your situation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What are the WL Martin Homes plans?</h3>
      <p>WL Martin Homes is a modular home manufacturer we partner with for select projects. Their plans offer proven layouts, faster framing timelines, and factory-controlled quality. We also build stick-built custom plans. <a href="/plans">Browse all plans here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I see model homes?</h3>
      <p>We don't have model homes because every project is on a unique lot with client-specific finishes. However, we can arrange site visits to active job sites (with client permission) so you can see construction quality and talk through the build process in person.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="construction" class="faq-category">
    <h2>During Construction</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>How often will I receive updates?</h3>
      <p>Weekly. Your project manager will provide regular updates via phone or email, and we document each phase with photos. You're also welcome to visit the job site anytime (coordinated with your PM for safety and scheduling).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I make changes during construction?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but changes become more expensive the further into construction we are. A change before framing is relatively inexpensive. A change after drywall is up requires demolition and rework. We encourage finalizing all decisions during the design retainer and permitting phases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What if I want to do some work myself to save money?</h3>
      <p>We generally don't allow owner-provided labor during construction due to liability, scheduling, and quality control concerns. However, you're welcome to handle landscaping, fencing, or other exterior work after final inspection and closing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do you build year-round?</h3>
      <p>Yes, though winter weather can slow certain phases like concrete work, grading, and septic installation. We account for seasonal factors when estimating timelines and communicate any weather-related delays promptly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What happens at the final walkthrough?</h3>
      <p>We walk through the completed home together, reviewing every room and system. You'll create a punch-list of any minor items that need correction (touch-up paint, hardware adjustments, etc.). We complete punch-list items before closing and key delivery.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="service-area" class="faq-category">
    <h2>Service Area</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Where do you build?</h3>
      <p>We specialize in Northern and Central Virginia, including Stafford, Spotsylvania, Culpeper, Fredericksburg, and parts of the DC metro area. If your lot is outside this area, contact us—we may be able to accommodate depending on location and project scope.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do you build in HOA communities?</h3>
      <p>Yes, if the HOA allows on-your-lot construction. We'll review HOA architectural guidelines during the design retainer phase to ensure your plan meets their requirements. Some HOAs have restrictive covenants that limit design flexibility.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do you build outside Virginia?</h3>
      <p>No. We're licensed and insured in Virginia and focus our expertise on local building codes, permitting processes, and site conditions specific to this region.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="after-completion" class="faq-category">
    <h2>After Completion</h2>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What warranty do you provide?</h3>
      <p>We provide a one-year builder warranty covering workmanship and materials. Systems and appliances have manufacturer warranties (HVAC, water heater, appliances, etc.). We'll provide all warranty documentation at closing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What if something goes wrong after I move in?</h3>
      <p>Contact us. If it's a warranty issue, we'll schedule a service visit to assess and repair. Most warranty items are minor (settling cracks, caulking, minor leaks) and addressed quickly. We stand behind our work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Do you handle post-construction landscaping?</h3>
      <p>We provide final grading, seeding, and basic erosion control as part of construction. Decorative landscaping (plants, mulch, hardscaping) is typically handled by the homeowner or a separate landscaping contractor after closing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Can I hire you for renovations or additions later?</h3>
      <p>Possibly. We focus primarily on new construction, but we've taken on select renovation and addition projects for past clients. Contact us to discuss your needs.</p>
